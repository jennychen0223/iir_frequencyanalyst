Ending all cases of poliomyelitis requires successful cessation of all oral poliovirus vaccine OPV but the Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI partners should consider the possibility of an OPV restart

More than 100 different enterovirus EV genotypes infect humans and contribute to substantial morbidity However current methods for characterisation of full length genomes are based on Sanger sequencing of short genomic regions which are labour intensive and do not enable comprehensive characterisation of viral populations Here we describe a simple and sensitive protocol for the amplification and sequencing of near full length genomes of human EV species using next generation sequencing EV genomes were amplified from 89 of samples tested with C

In 2009 a nationwide sentinel surveillance for hand foot mouth disease HFMD and herpangina HA with neurologic complications was initiated in South Korea We used this surveillance system to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with either HFMD or HA with neurologic complications with the aim of determining risk factors for severe neurologic complications

A newly developed bovine human reassortant pentavalent vaccine BRV PV ROTASIIL was tested for its potential effect on the immunogenicity of concomitantly administered EPI vaccines in infants in a randomized controlled study in India

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 infection can induce encephalitis which causes death or long term neurological sequelae especially in young children Using a murine infection model we searched for anti EV A71 agents because effective therapies are not available to control fatal infection In EV A71 infected mice treatment with the hematopoietic growth factor Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand Flt3 ligand before infection reduced the lethality and tissue viral loads Flt3 ligand failed to enhance the production of type I interferons Instead Flt3 ligand boosted the numbers of dendritic cells and particularly lymphocytes in infected organs with an expansion of spleen B cells and resulted in an increased titer of virus specific antibody with neutralizing activity in the serum The protective effect of Flt3 ligand was abolished in B cell deficient mice Our findings revealed that Flt3 ligand administration promotes resistance to EV A71 infection with enhanced B cell response in a mechanism rarely reported before

The enteric viruses shed by different populations can be influenced by multiple factors including access to clean drinking water We describe here the eukaryotic viral genomes in the feces of Ethiopian children participating in a clean water intervention trial

Enterovirus 71 EV A71 is one of the major pathogens causing hand foot and mouth disease HFMD Some strains can lead to neurological disease and fatality in children Up to date there is no FDA approved vaccine to prevent severe HFMD and mortality Although the inactivated vaccine has advanced to production in China lack of long term protection and the requirement of multiple boosters have necessitated the development of other types of vaccines Recent studies indicate that cellular and not humoral immunity determines the clinical outcome of EV A71 infections High levels of cytokines such as IL 1β IL 6 IL 10 and IFN γ tend to correlate with clinical severity in patients with pulmonary edema and encephalitis The live attenuated vaccine may serve as the preferred choice as it can induce excellent humoral and cellular immunity as well as live long immunity Expression of certain HLA alleles such as TNF α promoter type II 308 allele HLA A33 and HLA DR17 responses have been linked to severe HFMD However the high variability of MHC genes could restrict T cell recognition and be a major obstacle in the design of peptide vaccines Hence the development of a T cell universal vaccine incorporating both CD4

Recruitment of poliovirus PV RNA to the human ribosome requires the coordinated interaction of the viral internal ribosome entry site IRES and several host cellular initiation factors and IRES

Meningitis is one of the leading causes of death among patients living with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV in sub Saharan Africa Based on clinical presentations alone the different types of meningitis may not be distinguished from each other consequently accurate laboratory diagnosis is extremely essential Viruses such as Enteroviruses EV Mumps virus MuV and Herpes Simplex Virus 1 HSV 1 are implicated in cases of meningitis We sought to detect and characterize viral aetiologies of meningitis among HIV infected adults with the use of molecular tools

Cell autonomous immunity is the ability of individual cells to initiate a first line of host defense against invading microbes such as viruses Autophagy receptors a diverse family of multivalent proteins play a key role in this host response by detecting sequestering and eliminating virus in a process termed virophagy To counteract this positive stranded RNA viruses such as enteroviruses have evolved strategies to circumvent the host autophagic machinery in an effort to promote viral propagation however the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear Here we studied the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 and the autophagy receptor SQSTM1 sequestosome 1 p62 and CALCOCO2 NDP52 calcium binding and coiled coil domain containing protein 2 nuclear dot 10 protein 52 We demonstrated that SQSTM1 and CALCOCO2 differentially regulate CVB3 infection We showed that knockdown of SQSTM1 causes increased viral protein production and elevated viral titers whereas depletion of CALCOCO2 results in a significant inhibition of viral growth Both receptors appear to have a role in virophagy through direct interaction with the viral capsid protein VP1 that undergoes ubiquitination during infection Further investigation of the proviral mechanism of CALCOCO2 revealed that CALCOCO2 but not SQSTM1 suppresses the antiviral type I interferon signaling by promoting autophagy mediated degradation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling MAVS protein Moreover we demonstrated that viral proteinase 2A mediated cleavage of SQSTM1 at glycine 241 impairs its capacity to associate with viral capsid whereas cleavage of CALCOCO2 by viral proteinase 3C at glutamine 139 generates a stable C terminal fragment that retains the proviral function of full length CALCOCO2 Altogether our study reveals a mechanism by which CVB3 targets selective autophagy receptors to evade host virophagy

Recent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical have markedly increased worldwide A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks enterovirus 71 EV71 has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication however it is not clear whether coxsackievirus CVA6 the main agent for atypical HFMD also regulates the host cell cycle In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0 G1 phase Furthermore synchronization in G0 G1 phase but not S phase or G2 M phase promotes viral production To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0 G1 or G2 M Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0 G1 phase entry from G2 M phase and inhibits G0 G1 exit into S phase In line with its role to arrest cells in G0 G1 phase the expression of cyclinD1 CDK4 cyclinE1 CDK2 cyclinB1 CDK1 P53 P21 and P16 is regulated by CVA6 Finally the non structural proteins of CVA6 RNA dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0 G1 phase arrest These findings suggest that CVA6 infection arrested cell cycle in G0 G1 phase via non structural proteins 3D and 3C which may provide favorable environments for virus production

Henoch Schonlein Purpura HSP is one of the most common vasculitides of childhood with 10 20 cases per 100 000 children It frequently occurs following an infectious trigger and involves IgA and C3 deposition in small vessel walls HSP is characterized by palpable purpura plus IgA deposition on biopsy arthritis arthralgia renal involvement hematuria and or proteinuria and or abdominal pain It is not generally recognized as a cause of dilated coronary arteries

Enteroviral cardiomyopathy is a life threatening disease and detection of enterovirus EV RNA in the initial endomyocardial biopsy is associated with adverse prognosis and increased mortality Some patients with EV infection may spontaneously eliminate the virus and recover whereas those with virus persistence deteriorate and progress to heart failure Interferon beta IFN β therapy eliminates the virus resulting in increased survival of treated patients CCR5 is expressed on antigen presenting cells both macrophages and dendritic cells and immune effector cells T lymphocytes with memory effector phenotype and natural killer cells Its 32 bp deletion CCR5del32 is the most frequent human coding sequence mutation This study addresses the correlation of CCR5 polymorphism to the clinical course of EV infection and the necessity for IFN β treatment

The cellular mRNA decay protein AUF1 acts as a restriction factor during infection by picornaviruses including poliovirus coxsackievirus and human rhinovirus AUF1 relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during infection by these viruses due to the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking by viral proteinases Previous studies have demonstrated that AUF1 binds to poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 RNA during infection with binding shown to occur within the internal ribosome entry site IRES of the 5 noncoding region NCR or the 3 NCR respectively Binding to different sites within the viral RNA suggests that AUF1 may negatively regulate infection by these viruses using different mechanisms The work presented here addresses the mechanism of AUF1 inhibition of the replication of poliovirus and CVB3 We demonstrate that AUF1 knockdown in human cells results in increased viral translation RNA synthesis and virus production AUF1 is shown to negatively regulate translation of a poliovirus and CVB3 IRES reporter RNA during infection but not in uninfected cells We found that this inhibitory activity is not mediated through destabilization of viral genomic RNA however it does require virus induced relocalization of AUF1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the early phases of infection Our findings suggest that AUF1 restriction of poliovirus and CVB3 replication uses a common mechanism through the viral IRES which is distinct from the canonical role that AUF1 plays in regulated mRNA decay in uninfected host cells

Beginning in December 2013 an epidemic of chikungunya virus CHIKV infection spread across the Caribbean and into virtually all countries in the Western hemisphere with 2 4 million cases reported through the end of 2017

Coxsackievirus A10 CV A10 associated with Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD cases emerged increasingly in recent years In this study the samples from nation wide HFMD surveillance including 27 out of 31 provinces in China were investigated and the continuous and extensive virological surveillance covered 13 years were conducted to provide a comprehensive molecular characterization analysis of CV A10 855 CV A10 viruses 33 severe cases included were isolated from HFMD children patients during 2009 to 2016 in China 164 representative sequences from these viruses together with 117 CV A10 sequences downloaded from GenBank based on entire VP1 were recruited in this study Two new genotypes F and G and two sub genotypes C1 and C2 were identified Among 264 Chinese sequences 9 of them were genotype B 8 of them were C1 and the other 247 were C2 the predominant sub genotype in China since 2012 Chinese C2 viruses showed obvious temporal characteristics and can be divided into 3 clusters cluster 1 3 Cluster 3 viruses was circulating extensively during 2014 and 2016 with more severe cases It is very necessary and important to continuously conduct the extensive virological surveillance for CV A10 and further evolutionary studies will provide more evidence on its evolution and virulence

Young children are susceptible to enterovirus EV infections which cause significant morbidity in this age group However the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology of EVs and the circulating virus strains is mostly based on viruses detected in children with severe diseases leading to contact with the health care system while the vast reservoir of EVs that circulate in the general population is less characterized

Retinoic acid inducible gene I like receptor RLR is one of the most important pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system that detects positive and or negative stranded RNA viruses Subsequently it stimulates downstream transcription of interferon regulatory factor 3 IRF3 and nuclear factor κB NF κB inducing the production of interferons IFNs and inflammatory cytokines Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 TRAF6 is a key protein involved in the RLR mediated antiviral signalling pathway recruiting additional proteins to form a multiprotein complex capable of activating the NF κB inflammatory pathway Despite TRAF6 playing an important role in regulating host immunity and viral infection the deubiquitination of TRAF6 induced by viral infection remains elusive In this study we found that enterovirus 71 EV71 infection attenuated the expression of Ubiquitin specific protease 4 USP4 in vitro and in vivo while overexpression of USP4 significantly suppressed EV71 replication Furthermore it was found that EV71 infection reduced the RLR signalling pathway and enhanced the degradation of TRAF6 USP4 was also found to interact with TRAF6 and positively regulate the RLR induced NF κB signalling pathway inhibiting the replication of EV71 Therefore as a novel positive regulator of TRAF6 USP4 plays an essential role in EV71 infection by deubiquitinating K48 linked ubiquitin chains

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD caused by enteroviruses is an acute contagious disease in children Some severe infections caused by human enterovirus 71 HEV71 lead to rapid death in children with acute heart failure HF N terminal probrain natriuretic peptide NT proBNP is an important indicator of HF however its normal reference values in children and role in HFMD remain unclear This study aimed to investigate the correlation between NT proBNP and heart function and establish normal reference values of NT proBNP in children with HFMD aged 0 to 18 years In this study 95 normal reference values were established in 1031 healthy children aged 0 to 18 years The correlation between NT proBNP and left ventricular ejection LVEF was analyzed in 392 children with HFMD using Spearman correlation and receiver operating characteristic analysis NT proBNP levels were negatively correlated with LVEF in 392 children with HFMD The median NT proBNP level was 921 pg mL in the early cardiorespiratory failure group but only 55 pg mL in the nervous system involvement group Serum NT proBNP levels were negatively correlated with age The normal reference value in the neonatal period 0 to 1 month and adolescence 13 18 years was 250 0 to 3987 0 pg mL and 20 0 to 145 0 pg mL respectively NT proBNP levels can reflect the severity of HFMD and discriminate the second stage from the third stage of HFMD effectively NT proBNP is a useful biomarker to predict the early stage of severe HFMD in children with HF Different ages fit with different normal reference values of NT proBNP in children

BackgroundUnderstanding enterovirus D68 EV D68 circulation patterns as well as risk factors for severe respiratory and neurological illness is important for developing preventive strategies

Poliovirus PV 2CATPase is the most studied 2C protein in the Picornaviridae family It is involved in RNA replication encapsidation and uncoating and many inhibitors have been found that target PV 2CATPase Despite numerous investigations to characterize its functions a high resolution structure of PV 2C has not yet been determined We report here the crystal structure of a soluble fragment of PV 2CATPase to 2 55Å containing an ATPase domain a zinc finger and a C terminal helical domain but missing the N terminal domain The ATPase domain shares the common structural features with EV71 2C and other Superfamily 3 helicases The C terminal cysteine rich motif folds into a CCCC type zinc finger in which four cysteine ligands and several auxiliary residues assist in zinc binding By comparing with the known zinc finger fold groups we found the zinc finger of 2C proteins belong to a new fold group which we denote the Enterovirus 2C like group The C terminus of PV 2CATPase forms an amphipathic helix that occupies a hydrophobic pocket located on an adjacent PV 2CATPase in the crystal lattice The C terminus mediated PV 2C 2C interaction promotes self oligomerization most likely hexamerization which is fundamental to the ATPase activity of 2C The zinc finger is the most structurally diverse feature in 2C proteins Available structural and virological data suggest that the zinc finger of 2C might confer the specificity of interaction with other proteins We built a hexameric ring model of PV 2CATPase and visualized the previously identified functional motifs and drug resistant sites thus providing a structure framework for antiviral drug development

Many cellular processes are driven by spatially and temporally regulated microRNAs miRNAs dependent signaling events Substantial evidence collected over the years indicates that miRNAs are pivotal regulators that contribute to the initiation and development of EV71 related disorders Importantly so far no clinical trial has been undertaken to address the effect of miRNAs on EV71 related diseases In this study we show that EV71 infection results in up regulation of hsa miR 494 3p levels and that EV71 induced hsa miR 494 3p impacts PI3K Akt signaling pathway by targeting PTEN However very little is known about the relationship between hsa miR 494 3p and EV71 infection The overall goal of the study is to get a better insight into whether or not hsa miR 494 3p is involved in the EV71 infection We found that the EV71 infection induces cellular apoptosis and that this process can be counteracted by the over expression of hsa miR 494 3p mimics We also present evidence that cell lines deficient in hsa miR 494 3p are more sensitive to EV71 induced cell death than the corresponding control cells Collectively these findings confirm and extend the pervious observation suggesting that disturbances in miRNAs expression can influence EV71 propagation In addition they lend strong support to the ideas that hsa miR 494 3p mediated signaling pathway plays an important role in the EV71 replication and that this may have profound implications on our views on EV71 related diseases

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is a respiratory virus within the genus Enterovirus and the family of Picornaviridae Genetically it is closely related to rhinovirus that replicates in the respiratory tract and causes respiratory disease Since 2014 EV D68 has been associated with the neurologic syndrome of acute flaccid myelitis AFM

Febrile seizure is the most common childhood neurological disorder is an important health problem with potential short and long term complications also leading to economic burden and increased parental anxiety about fevers and seizures occurring in their children There are no routine recommendation to detect etiological causes of FS for neurological perspective further knowledge about the etiological causes of FS in children will support preventive measures and follow up strategies The aim of this study is to evaluate the percentage of respiratory viruses in children with FS

Surveillance for poliovirus during the polio endgame remains uncertain Building on prior modeling of the potential for undetected poliovirus transmission for conditions like those in Pakistan and Afghanistan we use a hypothetical model to explore several key characteristics of the poliovirus environmental surveillance ES system e g number and quality of sites catchment sizes and sampling frequency and characterize their impacts on the time required to reach high i e 95 confidence about no circulation CNC95 following the last detected case of serotype 1 wild poliovirus The nature and quality of the existing and future acute flaccid paralysis AFP surveillance and ES system significantly impact the estimated CNC95 for places like Pakistan and Afghanistan The analysis illustrates the tradeoffs between number of sites sampling frequency and catchments sizes and suggests diminishing returns of increasing these three factors beyond a point that depends on site quality and the location of sites Limitations in data quality and the hypothetical nature of the model reduce the ability to assess the extent to which actual ES systems offer benefits that exceed their costs Thus although poliovirus ES may help to reduce the time required to reach high confidence about the absence of undetected circulation the effect strongly depends on the ability to establish effective ES sites in high risk areas The costs and benefits of ES require further analysis

Only Pakistan and Afghanistan reported any polio cases caused by serotype 1 wild polioviruses WPV1s in 2017 With the dwindling cases in both countries and pressure to finish eradication with the least possible resources a danger exists of inappropriate prioritization of efforts between the two countries and insufficient investment in the two countries to finish the job We used an existing differential equation based poliovirus transmission and oral poliovirus OPV evolution model to simulate a proactive strategy to stop transmission and different hypothetical reactive strategies that adapt the quality of supplemental immunization activities SIAs in response to observed polio cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan To account for the delay in perception and adaptation we related the coverage of the SIAs in high risk undervaccinated subpopulations to the perceived i e smoothed polio incidence Continuation of the current frequency and quality of SIAs remains insufficient to eradicate WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan Proactive strategies that significantly improve and sustain SIA quality lead to WPV1 eradication and the prevention of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus cVDPV outbreaks Reactive vaccination efforts that adapt moderately quickly and independently to changes in polio incidence in each country may succeed in WPV1 interruption after several cycles of outbreaks or may interrupt WPV1 transmission in one country but subsequently import WPV1 from the other country or enable the emergence of cVDPV outbreaks Reactive vaccination efforts that adapt independently and either more rapidly or more slowly to changes in polio incidence in each country may similarly fail to interrupt WPV1 transmission and result in oscillations of the incidence Reactive strategies that divert resources to the country of highest priority may lead to alternating large outbreaks Achieving WPV1 eradication and subsequent successful OPV cessation in Pakistan and Afghanistan requires proactive and sustained efforts to improve vaccination intensity in under vaccinated subpopulations while maintaining high population immunity elsewhere

Coxsackievirus A16 CVA16 is an etiologic agent of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD that affects young children and although typically self limited severe complications and fatal cases have been reported Due to the lack of specific medication and vaccines against CVA16 there is currently a need to develop effective antivirals to better control CVA16 infections in epidemic areas In this study we identified the tannins chebulagic acid CHLA and punicalagin PUG as small molecules that can efficiently disrupt the CVA16 infection of human rhabdomyosarcoma cells Both compounds significantly reduced CVA16 infectivity at micromolar concentrations without apparent cytotoxicity A mechanistic analysis revealed that the tannins particularly targeted the CVA16 entry phase by inactivating cell free viral particles and inhibiting viral binding Further examination by molecular docking analysis pinpointed the targets of the tannins in the fivefold axis canyon region of the CVA16 capsid near the pocket entrance that functions in cell surface receptor binding We suggest that CHLA and PUG are efficient antagonists of CVA16 entry and could be of value as antiviral candidates or as starting points for developing molecules to treat CVA16 infections

Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 is the predominant pathogen of viral myocarditis In our previous study we found that CVB3 caused abnormal lipid accumulation in host cells However the underlying mechanisms by which CVB3 disrupts and exploits the host lipid metabolism are not well understood Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 SREBP1 is the major transcriptional factor in lipogenic genes expression In this study we demonstrated that CVB3 infection and nonstructural 2A protein upregulated and activated SREBP1a at the transcriptional level Deletion analysis of SREBP1a promoter revealed that two regions 1821 1490 and 312 217 in this promoter were both required for its activation by 2A These promoter regions possessed several binding motifs for transcription factor SP1 Next we used SP1 specific small interfering RNAs siRNAs to confirm that SP1 might be the essential factor in SREBP1a upregulation by 2A Furthermore we showed that MEK ERK pathway was involved in the activation of SREBP1a by 2A and that blocking this signaling pathway with the specific inhibitor U0126 attenuated SREBP1a activation and lipid accumulation by 2A Finally we showed that inhibition of SREBP1 with siRNAs attenuated lipid accumulation induced by CVB3 infection and reduced virus replication Moreover inhibition of the MEK ERK pathway also led to reduction of SREBP1a activation lipid accumulation and virus replication during CVB3 infection Taken together these data demonstrate that CVB3 nonstructural 2A protein activates SREBP1a at the transcription level through a mechanism involving MEK ERK signaling pathway and SP1 transcription factor which promotes cellular lipid accumulation and benefits virus replication

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 belongs to the picornavirus family and was first isolated in CA USA in 1962 EV D68 can cause severe cranial nerve system damage such as flaccid paralysis and acute respiratory diseases such as pneumonia There are currently no efficient therapeutic methods or effective prophylactics In this study we isolated the mAb A6 1 from an EV D68 infected rhesus macaque

The World Health Organization recommends the development of affordable next generation inactivated poliovirus vaccines IPV using attenuated poliovirus Sabin strains Previously we introduced a novel PER C6 cell culture platform which allows for high yield production of an affordable trivalent Sabin IPV vaccine

Until recently lung transplantation was not considered in patients with human immunodeficiency virus HIV HIV seropositive patients with suppressed viral loads can now expect long term survival with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapies HAART however HIV remains a relative contraindication to lung transplantation We describe to our knowledge the first HIV seropositive lung transplant recipient in Canada We also review the literature of previously reported cases of solid organ transplantation in patients with HIV with a focus on immunosuppression considerations

Israel experienced an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 WPV1 in 2013 2014 detected through environmental surveillance of the sewage system No cases of acute flaccid paralysis were reported and the epidemic subsided after a bivalent oral polio vaccination bOPV campaign As we approach global eradication polio will increasingly be detected only through environmental surveillance We developed a framework to convert quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR cycle threshold data into scaled WPV1 and OPV1 concentrations for inference within a deterministic compartmental infectious disease transmission model We used this approach to estimate the epidemic curve and transmission dynamics as well as assess alternate vaccination scenarios Our analysis estimates the outbreak peaked in late June much earlier than previous estimates derived from analysis of stool samples although the exact epidemic trajectory remains uncertain We estimate the basic reproduction number was 1 62 95 CI 1 04 2 02 Model estimates indicate that 59 95 CI 9 77 of susceptible individuals primarily children under 10 years old were infected with WPV1 over a little more than six months mostly before the vaccination campaign onset and that the vaccination campaign averted 10 95 CI 1 24 of WPV1 infections As we approach global polio eradication environmental monitoring with qPCR can be used as a highly sensitive method to enhance disease surveillance Our analytic approach brings public health relevance to environmental data that if systematically collected can guide eradication efforts

N6 methyladenosine m6A constitutes one of the most abundant internal RNA modifications and is critical for RNA metabolism and function It has been previously reported that viral RNA contains internal m6A modifications however only recently the function of m6A modification in viral RNAs has been elucidated during infections of HIV hepatitis C virus and Zika virus In the present study we found that enterovirus 71 EV71 RNA undergoes m6A modification during viral infection which alters the expression and localization of the methyltransferase and demethylase of m6A and its binding proteins Moreover knockdown of m6A methyltransferase resulted in decreased EV71 replication whereas knockdown of the demethylase had the opposite effect Further study showed that the m6A binding proteins also participate in the regulation of viral replication In particular two m6A modification sites were identified in the viral genome of which mutations resulted in decreased virus replication suggesting that m6A modification plays an important role in EV71 replication Notably we found that METTL3 interacted with viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase 3D and induced enhanced sumoylation and ubiquitination of the 3D polymerase that boosted viral replication Taken together our findings demonstrated that the host m6A modification complex interacts with viral proteins to modulate EV71 replication

Mutations associated with prolonged replication of the attenuated polioviruses found in oral poliovirus vaccine OPV can lead to vaccine derived poliovirus VDPV and cause paralysis indistinguishable from that caused by wild poliovirus In response the World Health Organization has initiated the transition to exclusive use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine IPV with OPV administration in cases of outbreak However it is currently unclear how IPV only vaccination well known to provide humoral but not mucosal immunity will impact the development of paralysis causing OPV variants Children infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV have been documented to show decreased mucosal immunity following OPV vaccination Thus HIV infected children vaccinated with OPV may serve as proxy for children with IPV only vaccination

We performed a review of the environmental surveillance methods commonly used to collect and concentrate poliovirus PV from water samples We compared the sampling approaches trap vs grab the process methods precipitation vs filtration and the various tools and chemical reagents used to separate PV from other viruses and pathogens in water samples microporous glass pads polyethylene glycol PEG dextran PEG sodium chloride NanoCeram ViroCap and ester membranes The advantages and disadvantages of each method are considered and the geographical areas where they are currently used are discussed Several methods have demonstrated the ability to concentrate and recover PVs from environmental samples The details of the particular sampling conditions and locations should be considered carefully in method selection

Enteric viruses in surface water pose considerable risk to morbidity in populations living around water catchments and promote outbreaks of waterborne diseases However due to poor understanding of the correlation between water quality and the presence of human enteric viruses the failure to assess viral contamination through alternative viral indicators makes it difficult to control disease transmission

Enteroviruses are the most frequent cause of acute meningitis and are seen increasingly in sepsis like disease and fever without source in the paediatric population Detection of enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid CSF specimens by PCR is the gold standard diagnostic test Our aim was to assess a method of detecting enterovirus in blood specimens by PCR

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is unique among enteroviruses because of the ability to cause severe respiratory disease as well as neurological disease We developed separate models of respiratory and neurological disease following EV D68 infection in AG129 mice that respond to antiviral treatment with guanidine In four week old mice infected intranasally EV D68 replicates to high titers in lung tissue increasing the proinflammatory cytokines MCP 1 and IL 6 The respiratory infection also produces an acute viremia In 10 day old mice infected intraperitoneally EV D68 causes a neurological disease with weight loss paralysis and mortality In our respiratory model treatment with guanidine provides a two log reduction in lung virus titers reduces MCP 1 and IL 6 and prevents histological lesions in the lungs Importantly viremia is prevented by early treatment with guanidine In our neurological model guanidine treatment protects mice from weight loss paralysis and mortality These results demonstrate the utility of these models for evaluation of antiviral therapies for EV D68 infection

To evaluate the association of enterovirus 71 EV71 susceptibility and clinical severity with polymorphisms in EV71 receptors including human scavenger receptor class B member 2 SCARB2 P selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 PSGL 1 and annexin II ANXA2

Tripartite motif containing 21 TRIM21 is a regulator of tissue inflammation and pro inflammatory cytokine production and has been implicated in negative regulation of IRF3 dependent type I interferon signaling However the antiviral activity of TRIM21 varies among diverse viruses and its role on regulation of type I interferon remains inconsistent in different microbial infections Here we investigate the potential role for TRIM21 in controlling Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 replication and susceptible organ pathology We found that CVB3 infection up regulated the expression of TRIM21 in hearts of mice and cardiomyocytes at early phase of infection Knock down of TRIM21 resulted in increased viral replication while overexpression led to increased phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3 increased IFN β transcription and reduced viral replication

BackgroundIn the Netherlands echovirus type 6 E6 is identified through clinical and environmental enterovirus surveillance CEVS and EEVS AimWe aimed to identify E6 transmission clusters and to assess the role of EEVS in surveillance and early warning of E6 MethodsWe included all E6 strains from CEVS and EEVS from 2007 through 2016 CEVS samples were from patients with enterovirus illness EEVS samples came from sewage water at pre specified sampling points E6 strains were defined by partial VP1 sequence month and 4 digit postcode Phylogenetic E6 clusters were detected using pairwise genetic distances We identified transmission clusters using a combined pairwise distance in time place and phylogeny dimensions ResultsE6 was identified in 157 of 3 506 CEVS clinical episodes and 92 of 1 067 EEVS samples Increased E6 circulation was observed in 2009 and from 2014 onwards Eight phylogenetic clusters were identified five included both CEVS and EEVS strains Among these identification in EEVS did not consistently precede CEVS One phylogenetic cluster was dominant until 2014 but genetic diversity increased thereafter Of 14 identified transmission clusters six included both EEVS and CEVS in two of them EEVS identification preceded CEVS identification Transmission clusters were consistent with phylogenetic clusters and with previous outbreak reports ConclusionAlgorithms using combined time place phylogeny data allowed identification of clusters not detected by any of these variables alone EEVS identified strains circulating in the population but EEVS samples did not systematically precede clinical case surveillance limiting EEVS usefulness for early warning in a context where E6 is endemic

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 infections are one of the main etiological agents of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and herpangina worldwide EV A71 infection is a life threatening communicable disease and there is an urgent global need for the development of vaccines for its prevention and control The morbidity rate of EV A71 infection differs between countries The pathogen s genetic lineages are undergoing rapid evolutionary changes An association between the occurrence of EV A71 infection and the circulation of different genetic strains of EV A71 virus has been identified around the world In this review we present and discuss the molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of the human disease caused by EV A71 infection as well as current prospects for the development of an EV A71 vaccine

In 2002 the WHO European Region was declared polio free Nonetheless global eradication has not yet been completed and the reintroduction from at risk areas is still possible This seroprevalence study evaluated samples collected from each Italian region in the 12 50 years old age range to assess protection against Poliovirus PV 1 2 and 3 among subjects immunised with different vaccination schedules 1073 samples 50 5 females were examined WHO standardized microneutralization assay was used Seroprotection rates were 92 9 96 2 and 83 4 for PV1 PV2 and PV3 respectively Geometric Mean Titres GMTs were higher for PV2 52 8 and PV1 41 1 than for PV3 21 0 Increasing the age a decreasing trend in seropositivity was observed in particular for PV3 The 2017 2019 Italian National Immunisation Plan emphasises as primary objective the maintenance of the polio free status and strongly validates the 2 1 schedule in the first year of life with IPV vaccine associated with the administration of booster doses at 6 years and during the adolescence Surveillance system and high population immunity are crucial to ensure the maintenance of polio free status

Enterovirus diseases are fecal orally transmitted and its transmission may be closely related with the drinking water quality and other environmental factors This study aimed to assess the association between environmental factors including drinking water quality and the incidence of enteroviral diseases in metropolitan provinces of Korea Using monthly number of hand foot mouth disease HFMD aseptic meningitis AM and acute hemorrhage conjunctivitis AHC cases generalized linear Poisson model was applied to estimate the effects of environmental factors on the monthly cases An increase of mean temperature was associated with an increase of enteroviral diseases at 0 2 months lag while an increase of turbidity was associated with increase in HFMD at 1 month lag and a decrease in AHC An increase of residual chlorine in municipal drinking water was associated with a decrease in HFMD and AHC 2 and 3 months later An increase of pH was associated with a maximum increase in AM 3 months later The meta analysis revealed the effects of the provincial and pooled variation in percent change of risks of environmental factors on HFMD AM and AHC cases at specific selected lags This study suggests that the drinking water quality is one of the major determinants on enteroviral diseases

Central nervous system CNS viral infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide but the systematic survey of patients admitted to hospitals with CNS infections in many countries including Indonesia is limited To obtain more information regarding the causes of CNS infections in Indonesia this study was performed to detect and identify viral agents associated with CNS infections amongst in patients at a referral hospital in Manado North Sulawesi Indonesia Adult patients admitted to R D Kandou General Hospital with presumed CNS infection were enrolled Cerebrospinal fluid serum and throat swab samples were collected and tested using molecular serological and virus isolation assays A confirmed viral etiology was established in three and a probable possible in 11 out of 74 patients The most common was herpes simplex virus 1 7 74 9 5 followed by Epstein Barr virus 2 74 2 7 cytomegalovirus 1 74 1 4 enterovirus D68 1 74 1 4 rhinovirus A 1 74 1 4 dengue virus 1 64 1 6 and Japanese encephalitis virus 1 64 1 6 There were 20 fatal cases 27 0 during hospitalization in which eight were associated with viral causes We identified herpes simplex virus 1 as the most common cause of CNS infection among adults in North Sulawesi with most of the cases remaining undiagnosed Our study highlights the challenges in establishing the etiology of viral CNS infections and the importance of using a wide range of molecular and serological detection methods to identify CNS viruses

As one of the key members of the coxsackievirus B group coxsackievirus B5 CV B5 can cause many central nervous system diseases such as viral encephalitis aseptic meningitis and acute flaccid paralysis Notably epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of CV B5 associated central nervous system CNS diseases have been reported worldwide throughout history In this study which was conducted to promote CV B5 vaccine and anti virus drug research a 3 day old BALB c mouse model was established using a CV B5 clinical isolate CV B5 JS417 as the challenge strain Mice challenged with CV B5 JS417 exhibited a series of neural clinical symptoms and death with necrosis of neuronal cells in the cerebral cortex and the entire spinal cord hindlimb muscles and cardiomyocytes The viral load of each tissue at various post challenge time points suggested that CV B5 replicated in the small intestine and was subsequently transmitted to various organs via viremia the virus potentially entered the brain through the spinal axons causing neuronal cell necrosis In addition this mouse model was used to evaluate the protective effect of a CV B5 vaccine The results indicated that both the inactivated CV B5 vaccine and anti CVB5 serum significantly protected mice from a lethal infection of CV B5 JS417 by producing neutralizing antibodies In summary the first CV B5 neonatal mouse model has been established and can sustain CNS infections in a manner similar to that observed in humans This model will be a useful tool for studies on pathogenesis vaccines and anti viral drug evaluations

Coxsackievirus A10 CVA10 a human type A Enterovirus HEV A can cause diseases ranging from hand foot and mouth disease to polio myelitis like disease CVA10 together with some other HEV As utilizing the molecule KREMEN1 as an entry receptor constitutes a KREMEN1 dependent subgroup within HEV As Currently there is no vaccine or antiviral therapy available for treating diseases caused by CVA10 The atomic resolution structure of the CVA10 virion which is within the KREMEN1 dependent subgroup shows significant conformational differences in the putative receptor binding sites and serotype specific epitopes when compared to the SCARB2 dependent subgroup of HEV A such as EV71 highlighting specific differences between the sub groups We also report two expanded structures of CVA10 an empty particle and uncoating intermediate at atomic resolution as well as a medium resolution genome structure reconstructed using a symmetry mismatch method Structural comparisons coupled with previous results reveal an ordered signal transmission process for enterovirus uncoating converting exo genetic receptor attachment inputs into a generic RNA release mechanism

Enteroviruses comprise a large group of mammalian pathogens that includes poliovirus Pathology in humans ranges from sub clinical to acute flaccid paralysis myocarditis and meningitis Until now all of the enteroviral proteins were thought to derive from the proteolytic processing of a polyprotein encoded in a single open reading frame Here we report that many enterovirus genomes also harbour an upstream open reading frame uORF that is subject to strong purifying selection Using echovirus 7 and poliovirus 1 we confirmed the expression of uORF protein in infected cells Through ribosome profiling a technique for the global footprinting of translating ribosomes we also demonstrated translation of the uORF in representative members of the predominant human enterovirus species namely Enterovirus A B and C In differentiated human intestinal organoids uORF protein knockout echoviruses are attenuated compared to the wild type at late stages of infection where membrane associated uORF protein facilitates virus release Thus we have identified a previously unknown enterovirus protein that facilitates virus growth in gut epithelial cells the site of initial viral invasion into susceptible hosts These findings overturn the 50 year old dogma that enteroviruses use a single polyprotein gene expression strategy and have important implications for the understanding of enterovirus pathogenesis

Acute flaccid paralysis AFP surveillance is key for global polio eradication It allows detecting poliovirus PV reintroductions from endemic countries This study describes AFP surveillance in Spain from 1998 to 2015 During this time 678 AFP cases were reported to the Spanish National Surveillance Network The mean notification rate was 0 58 AFP cases 100 000 population under 15 years old range 0 45 100 000 0 78 100 000 Two periods P are described P1 1998 2006 with the AFP notification rate ranging from 0 66 100 000 to 0 78 100 000 peaking in 2001 0 84 100 000 and P2 2007 2015 when the AFP rate ranged from 0 43 100 000 to 0 57 100 000 with the lowest rate in 2009 0 31 100 000 No poliomyelitis cases were caused by wild PV infections although two Sabin like PVs and one imported vaccine derived PV 2 were detected Overall 23 3 4 cases met the hot case definition Most cases were clinically diagnosed with Guillain Barré syndrome 76 9 504 655 The adequate stool collection rate ranged from 33 3 7 21 to 72 5 29 40 The annual proportion of AFP cases with non polio enterovirus findings varied widely across the study period AFP surveillance with laboratory testing for non polio enteroviruses must be maintained and enhanced both to monitor polio eradication and to establish sensitive surveillance for prompt detection of other enteroviruses causing serious symptoms

Acute respiratory infections ARIs are one of the major public health problems in developing countries like Nepal Besides the influenza several other pathogens are responsible for acute respiratory infection in children Etiology of infections is poorly characterized at the course of clinical management and hence empirical antimicrobial agents are used The objective of this study was to characterize the influenza and other respiratory pathogens by real time PCR assay A total of 175 throat swab specimens of influenza positive cases collected at National Influenza Center Nepal during the 2015 16 winter season were selected for detecting other respiratory copathogens Total nucleic acid was extracted using Pure Link viral RNA DNA mini kit Invitrogen and multiplex RT PCR assays were performed Influenza A and B viruses were found in 120 68 6 and 55 31 4 specimens respectively among which coinfections were found in 106 60 6 specimens Among the influenza A positive cases 25 20 8 were A H1N1 pdm09 and 95 79 2 were A H3 subtypes Viruses coinfected frequently with influenza virus in children were rhinovirus 26 14 8 respiratory syncytial virus A B 19 10 8 adenovirus 14 8 0 coronavirus CoV HKU1 14 8 0 CoV OC43 5 2 9 CoV 229E 2 1 1 metapneumovirus A B 5 2 9 bocavirus 6 3 4 enterovirus 5 2 9 parainfluenza virus 1 3 1 7 and parainfluenza virus 3 2 1 1 Coinfection of

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is a major etiological agent of human hand foot and mouth disease and it can cause severe neurological complications Although several genotypes of EV A71 strains are prevalent in different regions of the world the genotype C4 has circulated in mainland China for more than 20 years The pathogenicity of different EV A71 clinical isolates varies and needs to be explored In this study hSCARB2 knock in mice N 181 with a wide range of ages were tested for their susceptibility to two EV A71 strains with the subgenotypes C4 and C2 and two infection routes intracranial and venous were compared The clinical manifestations and pathology and their relationship to the measured viral loads in different tissues were monitored We observed that 3 weeks is a crucial age as mice younger than 3 week old that were infected became extremely ill However mice older than 3 weeks displayed diverse clinical symptoms Significant differences were observed in the pathogenicity of the two strains with respect to clinical signs disease incidence survival rate and body weight change We concluded that hSCARB2 knock in mice are a sensitive model for investigating the clinical outcomes resulting from infection by different EV A71 strains The intracranial infection model appears to be suitable for evaluating EV A71 neurovirulence whereas the venous infection model is appropriate for studying the pathogenicity of EV A71

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is a non polio enterovirus that affects the respiratory system and can cause serious complications especially in children and older people with weakened immune systems As an emerging virus there are no current antiviral therapies or vaccines available Our goal was to develop a mouse model of human EV D68 infection that mimicked the disease observed in humans and could be used for evaluation of experimental therapeutics This is the first report of a respiratory disease model for EV D68 infection in mice We adapted the virus by 30 serial passages in AG129 mice which are deficient in IFN α β and γ receptors Despite a lack of weight loss or mortality in mice lung function measured by plethysmography showed an increase in enhanced pause Penh on days 6 and 7 post infection In addition as virus adapted to mice virus titer in the lungs increased 50 fold and the pro inflammatory cytokines MCP 1 and RANTES increased 15 fold and 2 fold in the lung respectively In addition a time course of mouse adapted EV D68 infection was determined in lung blood liver kidney spleen leg muscle spinal cord and brain Virus in the lung replicated rapidly after intranasal inoculation of adapted virus 10

Coxsackievirus B is a significant human pathogen and is a leading cause of myocarditis We and others have observed that certain enteroviruses including coxsackievirus B cause infected cells to shed extracellular vesicles containing infectious virus Recent reports have shown that vesicle bound virus can infect more efficiently than free virus Though microRNAs are differentially regulated in cells following infection few have been associated with the vesicles shed from infected cells Here we report exclusive trafficking of specific microRNAs into viral vesicles compared to vesicles from non infected cells We found that the most highly expressed unique microRNA in viral vesicles was miR 590 5p which facilitates prolonged viral replication by blocking apoptotic factors Cells over expressing this miR were significantly more susceptible to infection This may be a mechanism by which coxsackievirus B boosts subsequent rounds of infection by co packaging virus and a select set of pro viral microRNAs in extracellular vesicles

Enteroviruses EVs are prime candidate environmental triggers of islet autoimmunity IA with potential as vaccine targets for type 1 diabetes prevention However the use of targeted virus detection methods and the selective focus on EVs by most studies increases the risk for substantial investigation bias and an overestimated association between EV and type 1 diabetes Here we performed comprehensive virome capture sequencing to examine all known vertebrate infecting viruses without bias in 182 specimens faeces and plasma collected before or at seroconversion from 45 case children with IA and 48 matched controls From 2 6 billion reads 28 genera of viruses were detected and 62 of children 58 93 were positive for 1 vertebrate infecting virus We identified 129 viruses as differentially abundant between the gut of cases and controls including 5 EV A types significantly more abundant in the cases Our findings further support EV s hypothesised contribution to IA and corroborate the proposal that viral load may be an important parameter in disease pathogenesis Furthermore our data indicate a previously unrecognised association of IA with higher EV A abundance in the gut of children and provide a catalog of viruses to be interrogated further to determine a causal link between virus infection and type 1 diabetes

The double stranded RNA binding protein Staufen1 Stau1 has multiple functions during RNA virus infection In this study we investigated the role of Stau1 in viral translation by using a combination of enterovirus 71 EV A71 infection RNA reporter transfection and in vitro functional and biochemical assays We demonstrated that Stau1 specifically binds to the 5 untranslated region of EV A71 viral RNA The RNA binding domain 2 3 of Stau1 is responsible for this binding ability Subsequently we created a Stau1 knockout cell line using the CRISPR Cas9 approach to further characterize the functional role of Stau1 s interaction with viral RNA in the EV A71 infected cells Both the viral RNA accumulation and viral protein expression were downregulated in the Stau1 knockout cells compared with the wild type naïve cells Moreover dysregulation of viral RNA translation was observed in the Stau1 knockout cells using ribosome fractionation assay and a reduced RNA stability of 5 UTR of the EV A71 was also identified using an RNA stability assay which indicated that Stau1 has a role in facilitating viral translation during EV A71 infection In conclusion we determined the functional relevance of Stau1 in the EV A71 infection cycle and herein describe the mechanism of Stau1 participation in viral RNA translation through its interaction with viral RNA Our results suggest that Stau1 is an important host factor involved in viral translation and influential early in the EV A71 replication cycle

Excessive or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines caused by severe viral infections often results in host tissue injury or even death Phospholipase C PLC s degrade phosphatidylinositol 4 5 bisphosphate PI 4 5 P2 lipids and regulate multiple cellular events Here we report that PLCβ2 inhibits the virus induced expression of pro inflammatory cytokines by interacting with and inhibiting transforming growth factor β activated kinase 1 TAK1 activation Mechanistically PI 4 5 P2 lipids directly interact with TAK1 at W241 and N245 and promote its activation Impairing of PI 4 5 P2 s binding affinity or mutation of PIP2 binding sites on TAK1 abolish its activation and the subsequent production of pro inflammatory cytokines Moreover PLCβ2 deficient mice exhibit increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and a higher frequency of death in response to virus infection while the PLCβ2 activator m 3M3FBS protects mice from severe Coxsackie virus A 16 CVA16 infection Thus our findings suggest that PLCβ2 negatively regulates virus induced pro inflammatory responses by inhibiting phosphoinositide mediated activation of TAK1

Infection by enteroviruses can cause severe neurological complications in humans The interactions between the enteroviral and host proteins may facilitate the virus replication and be involved in the pathogenicity of infected individuals It has been shown that human enteroviruses possess various mechanisms to suppress host innate immune responses in infected cells Previous studies showed that infection by enterovirus 71 EV71 causes the degradation of MDA5 which is a critical cytoplasmic pathogen sensor in the recognition of picornaviruses for initiating transcription of type I interferons In the present study we demonstrated that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRP also denoted 3D

Viral respiratory and intestinal infections are the most common causes of canine viral illness Infection with multiple pathogens occurs in many cases Rapid diagnosis of these multiple infections is important for providing timely and effective treatment To improve diagnosis in this study two new multiplex polymerase chain reactions mPCRs were developed for simultaneous detection of canine respiratory viruses CRV and canine enteric viruses CEV using two separate primer mixes The viruses included canine adenovirus type 2 CAV 2 canine distemper virus CDV canine influenza virus CIV canine parainfluenza virus CPIV canine circovirus CanineCV canine coronavirus CCoV and canine parvovirus CPV The sensitivity of the mPCR results showed that the detection limit of both mPCR methods was 1 104 viral copies Twenty nasal swabs NS and 20 anal swabs AS collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease were evaluated using the novel mPCR methods as a clinical test The mPCR protocols when applied to these respiratory specimens and intestinal samples could detect 7 viruses simultaneously allowing rapid investigation of CRV CAV 2 CDV CIV and CPIV and CEV CAV 2 CanineCV CCoV and CPV status and prompt evaluation of coinfection Our study provides an effective and accurate tool for rapid differential diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance in dogs

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is responsible for a heavy economic and social burden in the Asia Pacific region Previous studies have shown that coxsackievirus A6 CVA6 and coxsackievirus A10 CVA10 have become the predominant agents of HFMD in mainland China in recent years replacing enterovirus 71 EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 CVA16 although it is unclear if this is consistent throughout China In this study samples from 253 HFMD cases were collected in Shenzhen China from May 2013 through April 2014 to identify the etiological agent of HFMD In total 64 8 164 253 of HFMD cases were enterovirus positive in which 81 1 133 164 were determined to be CVA6 The phylogenetic tree of the partial viral protein 1 sequence showed that the CVA6 isolates were divided into four clusters Clusters A to D and cluster D was further divided into four sub clusters Clusters D1 to D4 The 133 CVA6 samples isolated in our study were classified into cluster D4 in which the first identified sequence was isolated in Shenzhen in 2008 This study demonstrated that the CVA6 cluster D4 which is predominantly circulating in HFMD in mainland China may have originated from a local strain identified in 2008 in Shenzhen

Viruses from the genus Enterovirus are important human pathogens Receptor binding or exposure to acidic pH in endosomes converts enterovirus particles to an activated state that is required for genome release However the mechanism of enterovirus uncoating is not well understood Here we use cryo electron microscopy to visualize virions of human echovirus 18 in the process of genome release We discover that the exit of the RNA from the particle of echovirus 18 results in a loss of one two or three adjacent capsid protein pentamers The opening in the capsid which is more than 120 Å in diameter enables the release of the genome without the need to unwind its putative double stranded RNA segments We also detect capsids lacking pentamers during genome release from echovirus 30 Thus our findings uncover a mechanism of enterovirus genome release that could become target for antiviral drugs

WHO recommends the introduction of at least one single dose of inactivated polio vaccine IPV in routine immunisation schedules Thus there has been an increased demand and concurrent supply shortages of IPV worldwide One of the strategies to improve access is the use of fractional instead of full doses of IPV We aim to compare the effects of fractional with standard doses of IPV

Recent worldwide outbreaks of enterovirus 71 EV71 have caused major epidemics of hand foot and mouth disease with severe neurological complications including acute flaccid paralysis EV71 is transmitted by the enteral route but little is known about the mechanisms it uses to cross the human gastrointestinal tract Using primary human intestinal epithelial monolayers we show that EV71 infects the epithelium from the apical surface where it preferentially infects goblet cells We found that EV71 infection did not alter epithelial barrier function but did reduce the expression of goblet cell derived mucins suggesting that it alters goblet cell function We also show that the intestinal epithelium responds to EV71 infection through the selective induction of type III interferons IFNs which restrict EV71 replication Collectively these findings define the early events associated with EV71 infections of the human intestinal epithelium and show that host IFN signaling controls replication in an IFN specific manner

Enterovirus 71 EV A71 is the main causative pathogen of childhood hand foot and mouth disease Effective medicine is currently unavailable for the treatment of this viral disease Using the fragment hopping strategy a series of 2 aryl isoindolin 1 one compounds were designed synthesized and investigated for their in vitro antiviral activity towards multiple EV A71 clinical isolates H BrCr Shenzhen98 Jiangsu52 in Vero cell culture in this study The structure activity relationship SAR studies identified 2 phenyl isoindolin 1 ones as a new potent chemotype with potent antiviral activity against EV A71 Ten out of the 24 tested compounds showed significant antiviral activity EC

Besides causing mild hand foot and mouth infections Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is associated with neurological complications and fatality With concerns about rising EV A71 virulence there is an urgency for more effective vaccines The live attenuated vaccine LAV is a more valuable vaccine as it can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses A miRNA based vaccine strain pIY carrying let 7a and miR 124a target genes in the EV A71 genome which has a partial deletion in the 5 NTR 11 bp and G64R mutation 3D

Like in many other countries virologic analyses are not routinely performed in Brazil in monitoring water quality for recreational purposes We surveyed current research regarding viral contamination of recreational water environments in Brazil Among the enteric viruses studied in Brazilian recreational waters we highlight adenoviruses rotaviruses enteroviruses and noroviruses Although there has been relatively little research on outbreaks related to bathing in recreational water environments in Brazil noroviruses and adenoviruses are the viruses that are most often related to outbreaks Better surveillance of the occurrence of enteric viruses in water could improve the assessment of risk to human health as well as indicate the sources of contamination and thus demonstrate the importance of adequate environmental sanitation

Enterovirus C96 EV C96 is a newly named type of enterovirus belonging to species C and the prototype strain BAN00 10488 was firstly isolated in 2000 from a stool specimen of a patient with acute flaccid paralysis in Bangladesh In this study we report the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of two EV C96 strains isolated from individuals from the Tibet Autonomous Region of China

Research in transformed immortalized cell lines indicates the cadherin related family member 3 CDHR3 protein serves as a receptor for human rhinovirus HRV C Similar experiments indicate that the CDHR3 coding variant rs6967330 increases CDHR3 protein surface expression

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is an emerging pathogen in the Enterovirus A species group EV A71 causes hand foot and mouth disease HFMD with virulent variants exhibiting polio like acute flaccid paralysis and other central nervous system manifestations We analysed all enterovirus A71 complete genomes with collection dates from 2008 to mid 2018 All sub genotypes exhibit a strong molecular clock with omega dN dS suggesting strong purifying selection In sub genotypes B5 and C4 positive selection can be detected at two surface sites on the VP1 protein also detected in positive selection studies performed prior to 2008 Toggling of a limited repertoire of amino acids at these positively selected residues over the last decade suggests that EV A71 may be undergoing a sustained frequency dependent selection process for immune evasion raising issues for vaccine development These same sites have also been previously implicated in virus host binding and strain associated severity of HFMD suggesting that immune evasion may be an indirect driver for virulence 154 words

Commuting network flows are generally asymmetrical with commuting behaviors bi directionally balanced between home and work locations and with weekday commutes providing many opportunities for the spread of infectious diseases via direct and indirect physical contact The authors use a Markov chain model and PageRank like algorithm to construct a novel algorithm called EpiRank to measure infection risk in a spatially confined commuting network on Taiwan island Data from the country s 2000 census were used to map epidemic risk distribution as a commuting network function A daytime parameter was used to integrate forward and backward movement in order to analyze daily commuting patterns EpiRank algorithm results were tested by comparing calculations with actual disease distributions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak and enterovirus cases between 2000 and 2008 Results suggest that the bidirectional movement model outperformed models that considered forward or backward direction only in terms of capturing spatial epidemic risk distribution EpiRank also outperformed models based on network indexes such as PageRank and HITS According to a sensitivity analysis of the daytime parameter the backward movement effect is more important than the forward movement effect for understanding a commuting network s disease diffusion structure Our evidence supports the use of EpiRank as an alternative network measure for analyzing disease diffusion in a commuting network

Enterovirus type 71 EV71 and coxsackievirus A 16 CA16 are the major pathogens of human hand foot and mouth disease HFMD In our previous study intramuscular immunization with the inactivated EV71 vaccine elicited effective immunity while immunization with the inactivated CA16 vaccine did not In this report we focused on innate immune responses elicited by inactivated EV71 and CA16 antigens administered intradermally or intramuscularly The distributions of the EV71 and CA16 antigens administered intradermally or intramuscularly were not obviously different but the antigens were detected for a shorter period of time when administered intradermally The expression levels of NF κB pathway signaling molecules which were identified as being capable of activating DCs ILCs and T cells were higher in the intradermal group than in the intramuscular group Antibodies for the EV71 and CA16 antigens colocalized with ILCs and DCs in skin and muscle tissues under fluorescence microscopy Interestingly ILC colocalization decreased over time while DC colocalization increased over time ELISpot analysis showed that coordination between DCs and ILCs contributed to successful adaptive immunity against vaccine antigens in the skin EV71 and or CA16 antigen immunization via the intradermal route was more capable of significantly increasing neutralizing antibody titers and activating specific T cell responses than immunization via the intramuscular route Furthermore neonatal mice born to mothers immunized with the EV71 and CA16 antigens were 100 protected against wild type EV71 or CA16 viral challenge Together our results provide new insights into the development of vaccines for HFMD

Enterovirus 71 EV A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 CV A16 are the most common causative agents causing hand foot and mouth disease HFMD However coxsackievirus A6 CV A6 previously largely ignored became the predominant pathogen in China in 2012 The objective of this study is to investigate the genetic characteristics and molecular epidemiology of HFMD caused by CV A6 to guide the diagnosis and treatment of the disease as well as disease prevention

We conducted a surveillance among acute respiratory tract infection ARTI cases to define the epidemiology clinical characteristics and genetic variations of enterovirus D68 EV D68 in Beijing China from 2015 to 2017 Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected from 30 sentinel hospitals in Beijing and subjected to EV and EV D68 detection by real time PCR The VP1 gene region and complete genome sequences of EV D68 positive cases were analyzed Of 21816 ARTI cases 619 2 84 were EV positive and 42 cases were EV D68 positive The detection rates of EV D68 were 0 0 6644 in 2015 0 53 40 7522 in 2016 and 0 03 2 7650 in 2017 respectively Two peaks of EV D68 infections occurred in late summer and early winter Ten cases 23 81 with upper respiratory tract infection and 32 cases 76 19 presented with pneumonia including 3 cases with severe pneumonia The phylogenetic analysis suggested 15 subclade D3 strains and 27 subclade B3 strains of EV D68 were circulated in China from 2016 to 2017 A total of 52 amino acid polymorphisms were identified between subclades D1 and D3 These data suggest an upsurge of EV D68 occurred in Beijing in 2016 the new subclade D3 emerged in 2016 and co circulated with subclade B3 between 2016 and 2017

SERPINA1 is a member of serine protease inhibitors and is increasingly considered to be a regulator of innate immunity in human and animals However the expression and function of SERPINA1 gene in immune defense against viral infection remain unknown in ducks The full length

Duck hepatitis A virus type 1 DHAV 1 is one of the most lethal pathogens in the duck industry The attenuated vaccine the CH60 strain is cultivated through serial passage in chicken embryos and is widely used for the prevention and control of the disease However the specific mechanism underlying its adaptation in chicken embryos has not been fully elucidated In this study we first infected chicken embryo fibroblasts CEFs with the DHAV 1 CH60 strain The peak of viral proliferation occurred within 36 48 h post infection The different DHAV 1 strains significantly induced the expression of IFNα IFNγ and Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 SOCS3 in CEFs and we found that SOCS3 overexpression significantly promoted viral replication Furthermore SOCS3 overexpression significantly inhibited the expression of IFNα but promoted the expression of IFNγ In addition SOCS3 overexpression clearly decreased the mRNA levels of STAT1 and STAT3 in the Janus kinase JAK STAT signaling pathway and inhibited the expression of the antiviral proteins MX1 and OASL Immune precipitation assays indicated that SOCS3 and IFNα do not physically interact Subcellular localization of SOCS3 and IFNα revealed that SOCS3 was mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm while IFNα was located only in the cytoplasm Co localization of these two proteins was not observed in the cytoplasm In conclusion the DHAV 1 CH60 strain may inhibit the expression of IFNα by increasing the SOCS3 protein and SOCS3 can in turn decrease STAT1 and STAT3 mRNA levels thereby inhibiting the antiviral protein MX1 and ultimately promoting viral proliferation indirectly assisting in viral adaptation in chicken embryos

Several host and viral processes contribute to forming infectious virions Polyamines are small host molecules that play diverse roles in viral replication We previously demonstrated that polyamines are crucial for RNA viruses however the mechanisms by which polyamines function remain unknown Here we investigated the role of polyamines in the replication of the bunyaviruses Rift Valley fever virus vaccine strain MP 12 and La Crosse virus LACV We found that polyamine depletion did not impact viral RNA or protein accumulation despite significant decreases in titer Viral particles demonstrated no change in morphology size or density Thus polyamine depletion promotes the formation of noninfectious particles These particles interfere with virus replication and stimulate innate immune responses We extended this phenotype to Zika virus however coxsackievirus did not similarly produce noninfectious particles In sum polyamine depletion results in the accumulation of noninfectious particles that interfere with replication and stimulate immune signaling with important implications for targeting polyamines therapeutically as well as for vaccine strategies

Several inactivated enterovirus A71 EV A71 vaccines are currently licensed in China however the development of additional EV A71 vaccines is ongoing necessitating extensive analysis of the molecular epidemiology of the virus worldwide Until 2012 laboratory confirmation of EV A71 for hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and other associated diseases had not occurred in the Philippines Because EV A71 has been linked with cases of acute flaccid paralysis AFP AFP surveillance is one strategy for documenting its possible circulation in the country To expand current knowledge on EV A71 molecular epidemiologic analysis and genetic characterization of EV A71 isolates were performed in this study

Polyamines are small positively charged molecules abundant in eukaryotic cells that are crucial to RNA virus replication In eukaryotic cells polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription translation and DNA replication and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood Picornaviruses including Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo however precisely how polyamine function in picornavirus infection has not been described Here we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine depleted conditions We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C proteases and we find that these mutant proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion Using a split luciferase reporter system to measure protease activity we determined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activity We further observe that the 2A and 3C protease mutations enhance reporter protease activity in polyamine depleted conditions Finally we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G during infection of polyamine depleted cells In sum our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease function during picornavirus infection Further these data highlight viral proteases as potential antiviral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine depleting antiviral therapies

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a common childhood disease which is usually caused by enterovirus A EV A serotypes Enterovirus A71 EV A71 and coxsackievirus A16 CV A16 are the main etiologic agents Multiple serotypes of enterovirus B serotypes EV B have been detected in outbreaks or sporadic cases of HFMD

Template dependent RNA replication mechanisms render picornaviruses susceptible to error catastrophe an overwhelming accumulation of mutations incompatible with viability Viral RNA recombination in theory provides a mechanism for viruses to counteract error catastrophe We tested this theory by exploiting well defined mutations in the poliovirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase RDRP namely a G64S mutation and an L420A mutation Our data reveal two distinct mechanisms by which picornaviral RDRPs influence error catastrophe fidelity of RNA synthesis and RNA recombination A G64S mutation increased the fidelity of the viral polymerase and rendered the virus resistant to ribavirin induced error catastrophe but only when RNA recombination was at wild type levels An L420A mutation in the viral polymerase inhibited RNA recombination and exacerbated ribavirin induced error catastrophe Furthermore when RNA recombination was substantially reduced by an L420A mutation a high fidelity G64S polymerase failed to make the virus resistant to ribavirin These data indicate that viral RNA recombination is required for poliovirus to evade ribavirin induced error catastrophe The conserved nature of L420 within RDRPs suggests that RNA recombination is a common mechanism for picornaviruses to counteract and avoid error catastrophe

Polio and enterovirus surveillance may include a number of approaches including incidence based observation a sentinel physician system environmental monitoring and acute flaccid paralysis AFP surveillance The relative value of these methods is widely debated Here we summarized the results of 14 years of environmental surveillance at four sewage treatment plants of various capacities in Moscow Russia A total of 5450 samples were screened yielding 1089 20 0 positive samples There were 1168 viruses isolated including types 1 3 polioviruses 43 and 29 different types of non polio enteroviruses 51 Despite using the same methodology a significant variation in detection rates was observed between the treatment plants and within the same facility over time The number of poliovirus isolates obtained from sewage was roughly 60 times higher than from AFP surveillance over the same time frame All except one poliovirus isolate were Sabin like polioviruses The one isolate was vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 with 17 6 difference from the corresponding Sabin strain suggesting long term circulation outside the scope of the surveillance For some non polio enterovirus types e g Echovirus 6 there was a good correlation between detection in sewage and incidence of clinical cases in a given year while other types e g Echovirus 30 could cause large outbreaks and be almost absent in sewage samples Therefore sewage monitoring can be an important part of enterovirus surveillance but cannot substitute other approaches

Virus inactivation mechanisms can be elucidated by methods that measure the loss of specific virus functionality e g host attachment genome internalization and genome replication Genome functionality is frequently assessed by PCR based methods which are indirect and potentially inaccurate genome damage that affects detection by high fidelity PCR enzymes may not adversely affect the ability of actual cellular enzymes to produce functional virus Therefore we developed here a transfection based assay to quantitatively determine viral genome functionality by inserting viral RNA into host cells directly to measure their ability to produce new functional viruses from damaged viral genomes Echovirus 11 was treated with ozone free chlorine FC UV light at 254 nm UV

The Immunization Program of Cuba was created in 1962 as a result of the political economic and social transformations initiated in 1959 when communicable diseases among them those preventable by vaccines were the main cause of morbidity and mortality in children Its organization and uninterrupted implementation allowed that six diseases two serious clinical forms and two serious complications were eliminated and the remaining ones have incidence and mortality rates that do not represent a health problem In Cuba an average of 4 8 million doses of simple or combined vaccines are administered annually protecting against 13 diseases including a pentavalent vaccine whose five components are produced in the country Oral polio vaccination in the 1962 campaign was the first experience in the Region of the Americas with community and intersectoral participation and Cuba was the first country to eliminate the disease Recent results of Cuban research have influenced the World Eradication Program The universal vaccination against hepatitis B at 24 hours after birth was achieved 19 years before the goal set by the World Health Organization using a national vaccine In Cuba vaccination is free and it is integrated into primary health care with universal access The commitment and political will to the health of the population is conveyed through a comprehensive health system Information and epidemiological surveillance are systematic reliable and sensitive Vaccination coverage is above 98 for all vaccines and the population has a high immune level

Duck viral hepatitis DVH is a highly contagious viral disease affecting ducks It can be caused by five agents including duck hepatitis A virus genotypes 1 DHAV 1 2 DHAV 2 and 3 DHAV 3 as well as duck hepatitis virus 2 and duck hepatitis virus 3 Since 2007 DHAV 3 has been known to be the most prevalent in East and South Asia So far the information regarding the propagation of DHAV 3 in cultured cells is limited In this study we describe the comparative studies on the growth properties of DHAV 3 in primary duck embryo fibroblast DEF cells using two different strains a virulent strain C GY and an attenuated strain YDF120 The effect of fetal calf serum FCS and chick serum CS on DHAV 3 replication and the mechanism of the inhibitory effect conferred by FCS were also investigated

Vimentin VIM is a surface receptor for enterovirus A71 mediating the initial binding and subsequent increase in EV A71 infectivity The caspid protein VP1 variation A289T is reportedly closely associated with less severe central nervous system CNS infections in humans However it is unclear whether VIM is associated with a reduction in CNS infections of EV A71 in the presence of A289T We investigated whether VIM served as a receptor for EV A71 in the presence of an A298T substitution in VP1 EV A71 289A and EV A71 289T were used to infect human rhabdomyosarcoma cells control human brain microvascular endothelial cells HBMECs and VIM knockout KO HBMECs and inoculated BALB c mice SV129 mice and VIM KO SV129 mice Furthermore we cloned VP1 289A Flag and VP1 289T Flag proteins for co immunoprecipitation analysis Analysis of viral function revealed that the capacity of viral attachment replication and protein synthesis and secretion decreased in HBMECs during an EV A71 289A infection the infectivity being higher than that of EV A71 289T upon VIM KO Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissue revealed that cerebral cortical damage was more extensive in EV A71 289A than in EV A71 289T infections in control SV129 mice however no significant difference was observed upon VIM KO Co immunoprecipitation analysis revealed an interaction between VP1 and VIM which was attenuated in VP1 harboring A289T however this attenuation was reversed by VIM 1 58 peptide The A289T variation of VP1 specifically decreased the virulence of EV A71 in HBMECs and the attenuated interaction between VP1 harboring the A289T variation and VIM essentially decreased the CNS infectivity of EV A71 in vitro and vivo

Fresh produce irrigated with surface water that may contain pathogens such as enteric viruses can lead to outbreaks of foodborne viral illnesses In the current study we performed real time PCR qPCR to monitor the presence of enteric viruses such as human adenoviruses HAdVs hepatitis A virus HAV rotavirus group A RVA and norovirus GI NoV GI in surface water and fresh produce that were grown using this surface water in Egypt Samples were collected on four occasions from different sites located in the Delta and in Greater Cairo Egypt Of the 32 water samples and 128 fresh produce samples 27 32 84 3 and 99 128 77 3 respectively were positive for at least one virus HAdV 30 32 with a mean viral load 1 5 10

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is typically transmitted by the oral faecal route and initiates infection upon crossing the intestinal mucosa Our limited understanding of the mechanisms by which it crosses the intestinal mucosa has hampered the development of effective therapeutic options Here using an RNA interference screen combined with chemical inhibitors or the overexpression of dominant negative proteins we found that EV71 entry into Caco 2 cells a polarized human intestinal epithelial cell line does not involve clathrin and caveolae dependent endocytic pathways or macropinocytosis but requires GTP binding protein dynamin 2 and cytoskeleton remodelling The use of siRNAs targeting endophilin family members revealed that endophlin A2 is essential for the uptake of EV71 particles by Caco 2 cells Subcellular analysis revealed that internalized EV71 virions largely colocalized with endophilin A2 at cytomembrane ruffles and in the perinuclear area Combined with viral entry kinetics these data suggest that EV71 enters Caco 2 cells mainly via an endophilin A2 mediated endocytic EME pathway Finally we showed that internalized EV71 virions were transported to endosomal sorting complex required for transport ESCRT related multivesicular bodies MVBs These data provide attractive therapeutic targets to block EV71 infection

The etiology of myositis is unknown Although attempts to identify viruses in myositis skeletal muscle have failed several studies have identified the presence of a viral signature in myositis patients Here we postulate that in individuals with susceptible genetic backgrounds viral infection alters the epigenome to activate the pathological pathways leading to disease onset To identify epigenetic changes methylation profiling of Coxsackie B infected human myotubes and muscle biopsies from polymyositis PM and dermatomyositis DM patients were compared to changes in global transcript expression induced by in vitro Coxsackie B infection Gene and protein expression analysis and live cell imaging were performed to examine the mechanisms Analysis of methylation and gene expression changes identified that a mitochondria localized activator of apoptosis harakiri HRK is upregulated in myositis skeletal muscle cells Muscle cells with higher HRK expression have reduced mitochondrial potential and poor ability to repair from injury as compared to controls In cells from myositis patient toll like receptor 7 TLR7 activates and sustains high HRK expression Forced over expression of HRK in healthy muscle cells is sufficient to compromise their membrane repair ability Endurance exercise that is associated with improved muscle and mitochondrial function in PM and DM patients decreased TLR7 and HRK expression identifying these as therapeutic targets Increased HRK and TLR7 expression causes mitochondrial damage leading to poor myofiber repair myofiber death and muscle weakness in myositis patients and exercise induced reduction of HRK and TLR7 expression in patients is associated with disease amelioration 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland Published by John Wiley Sons Ltd

Outbreaks of enterovirus D68 EV D68 respiratory infections in children were reported globally in 2014 In Japan there was an EV D68 outbreak in the autumn of 2015 September October The aim of this study was to compare EV D68 specific polymerase chain reaction PCR positive and EV D68 specific PCR negative patients

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD a highly contagious disease in children is caused by human enteroviruses including enterovirus 71 EV71 coxsackievirus A16 CVA16 and coxsackievirus A6 CVA6 Although HFMD is usually mild and self limiting EV71 infection occasionally leads to fatal neurological disorders Currently no commercial antiviral drugs for HFMD treatment are available Here numerous sulfonated azo dyes widely used as food additives were identified as having potent antiviral activities against human enteroviruses Among them brilliant black BN E151 was able to inhibit all EV71 CVA16 and CVA6 strains tested In rhabdomyosarcoma cells the 50 inhibitory concentrations of the dye E151 for various strains of EV71 ranged from 2 39 μM to 28 12 μM whereas its 50 cytotoxic concentration was 1 870 μM Food azo dyes including E151 interacted with the vertex of the 5 fold axis of EV71 and prevented viral entry Their efficacy in viral inhibition was regulated by amino acids at VP1 98 VP1 145 and or VP1 246 Dye E151 not only prevented EV71 attachment but also eluted attached viruses in a concentration dependent manner Moreover E151 inhibited the interaction between EV71 and its cellular uncoating factor cyclophilin A

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is well recognized as one of the major threats to children s health globally The increasing complexity of the etiology of HFMD still challenges disease control in China There is little surveillance of the molecular epidemiological characteristics of the enteroviruses EVs that cause HFMD in Neijiang city or the Sichuan Basin area in Southwest China In this study demographic and epidemiological information for 14 928 probable HFMD cases was extracted and analyzed to describe the epidemic features of HFMD in Neijiang city from Jan 2010 to Dec 2017 The swab samples of select probable HFMD cases from 2012 to 2017 were tested by reverse transcription RT real time PCR to identify the serotype distribution of EVs and 110 randomly selected RT real time PCR positive samples were then amplified and analyzed for the VP1 or VP4 regions of EVs to further analyze the phylogenetic characteristics of the circulating strains in this area The eight year average annual incidence was 49 82 per 100 000 in Neijiang The incidence rates varied between 19 51 and 70 73 per 100 000 demonstrating peaks of incidence in even number years 2012 2014 and 2016 The median age of the probable cases was 27 months and the interquartile range 25th to 75th percentile of ages for the probable HFMD cases was between 14 and 42 months The male to female ratio of the probable HFMD cases was 1 47 1 and scattered children were the major population classification 81 7 Two epidemic peaks were observed one major peak between April and July and the other lesser peak between October and December Of 6513 probable cases tested with RT real time PCR 4015 61 6 were positive for enterovirus with the serotype distribution as follows EV71 30 1 n 1210 CV A16 28 7 n 1154 and a sole pan enterovirus 41 1 n 1651 A total of 91 cases 82 7 91 110 were successfully amplified and underwent phylogenetic analysis all EV71 cases were C4a serotype n 23 30 all CV A16 cases were B2b serotype n 24 30 of 42 sole pan enterovirus samples 20 were CV A6 14 were CV A10 and the rest within this group were CV A4 n 4 CV A8 n 2 CV A9 n 1 and CV B3 n 1 Our findings provide important evidence that aids the improvement of strategies for vaccination against HFMD and comprehensive disease control in China

Rhino and enteroviruses are important human pathogens against which no antivirals are available The best studied inhibitors are capsid binders that fit in a hydrophobic pocket of the viral capsid Employing a new class of entero rhinovirus inhibitors and by means of cryo electron microscopy EM followed by resistance selection and reverse genetics we discovered a hitherto unknown druggable pocket that is formed by viral proteins VP1 and VP3 and that is conserved across entero rhinovirus species We propose that these inhibitors stabilize a key region of the virion thereby preventing the conformational expansion needed for viral RNA release A medicinal chemistry effort resulted in the identification of analogues targeting this pocket with broad spectrum activity against Coxsackieviruses B CVBs and compounds with activity against enteroviruses EV of groups C and D and even rhinoviruses RV Our findings provide novel insights in the biology of the entry of entero rhinoviruses and open new avenues for the design of broad spectrum antivirals against these pathogens

Enterovirus genome replication occurs at virus induced structures derived from cellular membranes and lipids However the origin of these replication organelles ROs remains uncertain Ultrastructural evidence of the membrane donor is lacking suggesting that the sites of its transition into ROs are rare or fleeting To overcome this challenge we combined live cell imaging and serial block face scanning electron microscopy of whole cells to capture emerging enterovirus ROs The first foci of fluorescently labeled viral protein correlated with ROs connected to the endoplasmic reticulum ER and preceded the appearance of ROs stemming from the

Positive stranded RNA viruses extensively remodel host cell architecture to enable viral replication Here we examined the poorly understood formation of specialized membrane compartments that are critical sites for the synthesis of the viral genome We show that the replication compartments RCs of enteroviruses are created through novel membrane contact sites that recruit host lipid droplets LDs to the RCs Viral proteins tether the RCs to the LDs and interact with the host lipolysis machinery to enable transfer of fatty acids from LDs thereby providing lipids essential for RC biogenesis Inhibiting the formation of the membrane contact sites between LDs and RCs or inhibition of the lipolysis pathway disrupts RC biogenesis and enterovirus replication Our data illuminate mechanistic and functional aspects of organelle remodeling in viral infection and establish that pharmacological targeting of contact sites linking viral and host compartments is a potential strategy for antiviral development

We have previously reported a new class of dendrimers with tryptophan Trp residues on the surface that show dual antiviral activities against HIV and enterovirus EV71 The prototype compound of this family is a derivative of pentaerythritol with 12 peripheral Trp groups and trivalent spacer arms Here a novel series of dendrimers with divalent and tetravalent branched arms instead of the trivalent ones present on the prototype has been synthesized and its activity against HIV EV71 and a panel of 16 different viruses and other pathogens has been determined Convergent or divergent approaches have been used for the synthesis of these compounds Our findings demonstrate that only compounds with tetravalent branched arms showed the same anti HIV and anti EV71 activity of the prototype low micromolar and even gain significant antiviral activity against new pathogens such as HSV 2 adenovirus 2 human corona virus and respiratory syncytial virus being the first members of the Trp dendrimer family that showed activity against those viruses As the prototype these compounds also showed low nanomolar activity against a representative EV71 clinical isolate Experimental work carried on to determine the mode of action of the most potent IIa containing tetravalent branched arms demonstrated that it interacts with the viral envelopes of HIV EV71 and HSV 2 and thus may prevent virus attachment to the host cell These results support the interest of this new series of Trp dendrimers and qualify them as useful prototypes for the development of novel inhibitors of viral entry with broad antiviral spectrum

Clinical signs and symptoms of central nervous system CNS infections in neonates are often nonspecific Therefore cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis is performed to diagnose CNS infections Data on combined microbiological results and their correlation with biochemical characteristics in CSF and blood in infants younger than 90 days are limited This study provides an overview of microbiological test results CSF and hematological characteristics among infants with a clinically suspected CNS infection This retrospective study included infants younger than 90 days with a clinically suspected CNS infection who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture between January 2012 and January 2014 Data on the presence of microbiological pathogens in CSF CSF inflammation markers white blood cell WBC counts protein levels and glucose CSF serum ratio and blood inflammatory responses WBC count C reactive protein CRP neutrophil percentage were collected by reviewing patient files We included data from 576 infants median age 12 5 days interquartile range 6 27 days of whom 383 66 5 were born prematurely In total 16 bacterial pathogens 3 0 and 21 viruses 5 5 were detected in CSF Escherichia coli was detected in 5 cases 1 0 Enterovirus was detected in 12 cases 3 1 Leucocytosis in CSF was associated with identification of a pathogen in CSF Increased CRP was associated with the identification of a bacterial pathogen in CSF Bacterial or viral pathogens were only identified in a small proportion of infants with a clinically suspected CNS infection Leucocytosis in CSF was associated with CNS infection in infants An increased CRP was indicative of bacterial meningitis

Apoptosis plays a crucial role in regulating cardiomyopathy and injuries of coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 induced viral myocarditis VM It has been reported that Astragaloside IV AST IV from Astragalus membranaceus could inhibit apoptosis under a variety of pathological conditions in vivo or in vitro However the functional roles of AST IV in CVB3 induced VM still remain unknown Here we found that AST IV significantly enhanced survival for CVB3 induced mice AST IV protected the mice against CVB3 induced virus myocarditis characterized by the increased body weight decreased serum level of creatine kinase MB CK MB and lactate dehydrogenase LDH supressed expression of Ifn γ Il 6 in heart enhanced systolic and diastolic function of left ventricle At the pathological level AST IV ameliorated the mice against CVB3 induced myocardial damage and myocardial fibrosis In vitro the results from flow cytometry showed that AST IV significantly suppressed CVB3 induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis which also were verified in vivo Moreover an increased expression of pro apoptotic genes including FAS FASL cleaved caspase 8 and cleaved caspase 3 was found in CVB3 induced cardiomyocytes while those was inhibited in cardiomyocytes treated with AST IV Taken together the data suggest that AST IV protected against CVB3 induced myocardial damage and fibrosis which may partly attribute to supress activation of FAS FASL signaling pathway

Oxysterol binding Protein OSBP is a human lipid transport protein required for the cellular replication of many types of viruses including several human pathogens The structurally diverse small molecule compounds OSW 1 itraconazole ITZ T 00127 HEV2 THEV and TTP 8307 TTP inhibit viral replication through interaction with the OSBP protein The OSW 1 compound reduces intracellular OSBP and the reduction of OSBP protein levels persists multiple days after the OSW 1 compound treatment is stopped The OSW 1 induced reduction of OSBP levels inhibited Enterovirus replication prophylactically in cells In this report the OSBP interacting compounds ITZ THEV and TTP are shown not to reduce OSBP levels in cells unlike the OSW 1 compound and the OSW 1 compound is determined to be the only compound capable of providing prophylactic antiviral activity in cells Furthermore OSW 1 and THEV inhibit the binding of 25 hydroxycholesterol 25 OHC to OSBP indicating that these compounds bind at the conserved sterol ligand binding site The ITZ and TTP compounds do not inhibit 25 hydroxycholesterol binding to OSBP and therefore ITZ and TTP interact with OSBP through other unidentified binding sites Co administration of the THEV compound partially blocks the cellular activity of OSW 1 including the reduction of cellular OSBP protein levels co administration of the ITZ and TTP compounds have minimal effect on OSW 1 cellular activity further supporting different modes of interaction with these compounds to OSBP OSW 1 ITZ THEV and TTP treatment alter OSBP cellular localization and levels but in four distinct ways Co administration of OSW 1 and ITZ induced OSBP cellular localization patterns with features similar to the effects of ITZ and OSW 1 treatment alone Based on these results OSBP is capable of interacting with multiple structural classes of antiviral small molecule compounds at different binding sites and the different compounds have distinct effects on OSBP cellular activity

Coxsackieviruses B CV B belong to the EV B species CV B and particularly CV B4 are thought to be involved in the development of chronic diseases like type 1 diabetes T1D The mechanisms of the enteroviral pathogenesis of T1D are not well known yet The in vitro studies are rich with information but in vivo infection models are needed to investigate the impact of viruses onto organs Our objective was to study the impact of CV B4E2 combined with a single sub diabetogenic dose of streptozotocin STZ on the pancreas of mice The infection with CV B4E2 of CD1 outbred mice treated with a sub diabetogenic dose of STZ induced hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia Along with the chemokine IP 10 viral RNA and infectious particles were detected in the pancreas The pancreas of these animals was also marked with insulitis and other histological alterations The model combining STZ and CV B4E2 opens the door to new perspectives to better understand the interactions between virus and host and the role of environmental factors capable like STZ to predispose the host to the diabetogenic effects of enteroviruses

Enteroviruses are a major cause of human disease Adipose specific phospholipase A2 PLA2G16 was recently identified as a pan enterovirus host factor and potential drug target In this study we identify a possible mechanism of PLA2G16 evasion by employing a dual glycan receptor binding enterovirus D68 EV D68 strain We previously showed that this strain does not strictly require the canonical EV D68 receptor sialic acid Here we employ a haploid screen to identify sulfated glycosaminoglycans sGAGs as its second glycan receptor Remarkably engagement of sGAGs enables this virus to bypass PLA2G16 Using cryo EM analysis we reveal that in contrast to sialic acid sGAGs stimulate genome release from virions via structural changes that enlarge the putative openings for genome egress Together we describe an enterovirus that can bypass PLA2G16 and identify additional virion destabilization as a potential mechanism to circumvent PLA2G16

Echovirus 11 E 11 is one of the most frequently isolated enteroviruses causing meningitis and other diseases such as hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and acute flaccid paralysis AFP Fifty nine newly determined E 11 VP1 sequences from the China AFP and HFMD surveillance network and 500 E 11 VP1 sequences obtained from the GenBank database which were associated with 12 categories of diseases were screened for phylogenetic analysis Based on the standard method of genotype classification E 11 strains circulated worldwide were reclassified into six genotypes as A B C D E and F in which genotype F is newly divided and genotypes A and C are further divided into A1 5 and C1 4 by this research whereas genotype D was still divided into D1 5 as in a previous study of Oberste et al Sub genotype A1 was the predominant sub genotype in mainland China between 2008 2017 whereas sub genotype D5 was the predominant sub genotype circulated outside China from 1998 2014 However genotype and sub genotype spectra showed statistical significance among AFP and HFMD cases χ

Acute flaccid myelitis is characterized by the combination of acute flaccid paralysis and a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to the gray matter on magnetic resonance imaging The term acute flaccid myelitis was introduced in 2014 after the upsurge of pediatric cases in the USA with enterovirus D68 infection Since then an increasing number of cases have been reported worldwide Whereas the terminology is new the clinical syndrome has been recognized in the past in association with several other neurotropic viruses such as poliovirus Conclusion This review presents the current knowledge on acute flaccid myelitis with respect to the clinical presentation and its differential diagnosis with Guillain Barré syndrome and acute transverse myelitis We also discuss the association with enterovirus D68 and the presumed pathophysiological mechanism of this infection causing anterior horn cell damage Sharing clinical knowledge and insights from basic research is needed to make progress in diagnosis treatment and prevention of this new polio like disease What is Known Acute flaccid myelitis AFM is a polio like condition characterized by rapid progressive asymmetric weakness together with specific findings on MRI AFM has been related to different viral agents but recent outbreaks are predominantly associated with enterovirus D68 What is New Improving knowledge on AFM must increase early recognition and adequate diagnostic procedures by clinicians The increasing incidence of AFM urges cooperation between pediatricians neurologists and microbiologists for the development of treatment and preventive options

Aseptic meningitis is a common viral infection associated with human enteroviruses The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize the enteroviruses associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of aseptic meningitis that occurred in different regions of Brazil between 2013 and 2017 Cerebrospinal fluids obtained from patients admitted to public health facilities were analyzed A total of 303 patients were positive for Human Enteroviruses EV by cell culture isolation with a median isolation rate throughout the year of 12 We were able to identify enterovirus serotypes in 295 clinical specimens Nineteen different serotypes were identified the large majority corresponded to HEV B species Echovirus 30 E 30 and Echovirus 6 E 6 were the most prevalent genotypes 66 8 Sequence analysis suggested that circulating E 30 was closely related to E 30 from other American countries while E 6 was derived from Europe Most of the patients consisted of children 15 years old The temporal distribution of all aseptic meningitis and EV positive cases showed an obvious seasonal pattern during autumn Our results have provided valuable information about the enteroviral etiology of the aseptic meningitis cases in Brazil pointing to the importance of enterovirus surveillance in neurological diseases

The cocirculation of duck hepatitis A virus subtypes 1 DHAV 1 and 3 DHAV 3 in ducklings has resulted in significant economic losses Ducklings with DHAV 1 or DHAV 3 infection show similar clinical signs and gross lesions hence it is important to identify the viral subtypes in infected ducklings as early as possible for better clinical management

The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children with peripheral facial nerve palsy pFP with a focus on identifying infectious etiology and long term outcome We conducted an ICD 10 based retrospective chart review on children hospitalized with pFP between January 1 2006 and December 31 2016 Furthermore a telephone based follow up survey was performed A total of 158 patients were identified with a median age of 10 9 years interquartile range 6 4 13 7 An infectious disease was associated with pFP in 82 patients 51 9 73 cases were classified as idiopathic pFP 46 2 Three cases occurred postoperatively or due to a peripheral tumor Among the infectious diseases we identified 33 cases of neuroborreliosis and 12 viral infections of the central nervous system CNS caused by the varicella zoster virus human herpesvirus 6 herpes simplex virus enterovirus and Epstein Barr virus Other infections were mainly respiratory tract infections RTIs 37 cases Children with an associated CNS infection had more often headache and nuchal rigidity a higher cerebrospinal fluid cell count and a longer length of hospital stay Long term follow up revealed an associated lower risk of relapse in CNS infection associated pFP Among all groups permanent sequelae were associated with female sex a shorter length of hospitalization and a lower white blood cell count at presentation pFP is frequently caused by an CNS infection or is associated with concurrent RTIs with a potential impact on the short and long term clinical course

Enterovirus B species typically cause a rapid cytolytic infection leading to efficient release of progeny viruses However they are also capable of persistent infections in tissues which are suggested to contribute to severe chronic states such as myocardial inflammation and type 1 diabetes In order to understand the factors contributing to differential infection strategies we constructed a chimera by combining the capsid proteins from fast cytolysis causing echovirus 1 EV1 with nonstructural proteins from coxsackievirus B5 CVB5 which shows persistent infection in RD cells The results showed that the chimera behaved similarly to parental EV1 leading to efficient cytolysis in both permissive A549 and semipermissive RD cells In contrast to EV1 and the chimera CVB5 replicated slowly in permissive cells and showed persistent infection in semipermissive cells However there was no difference in the efficiency of uptake of CVB5 in A549 or RD cells in comparison to the chimera or EV1 CVB5 batches constantly contained significant amounts of empty capsids also in comparison to CVB5 s close relative CVB3 During successive passaging of batches containing only intact CVB5 increasing amounts of empty and decreasing amounts of infective capsids were produced Our results demonstrate that the increase in the amount of empty particles and the lowering of the amount of infective particles are dictated by the CVB5 structural proteins leading to slowing down of the infection between passages Furthermore the key factor for persistent infection is the small amount of infective particles produced not the high number of empty particles that accumulate

Enteroviruses EVs are associated with a broad spectrum of disease manifestations including aseptic meningitis encephalitis hand foot and mouth disease acute flaccid paralysis and acute flaccid myelitis with outbreaks being reported frequently world wide The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of all enteroviruses detected in Cyprus in the ten year period from January 2008 and December 2017 as well as a description of the circulation patterns associated with the most frequently encountered genotypes For this purpose serum cerebrospinal fluid nasal swab skin swab and or stool samples from 2666 patients with a suspected EV infection were analysed between January 2008 and December 2017 Enteroviruses were detected in 295 11 1 patients which were then investigated further for epidemiological analysis by VP1 genotyping Overall 24 different enterovirus types belonging to three different species were identified The predominant species was EV B 209 295 71 followed by species EV A 77 295 26 1 Only one virus belonged to species EV D whereas EV C enteroviruses were not identified at all The most frequent genotypes identified were echovirus 30 26 1 echovirus 6 14 2 and coxsackievirus A6 10 9 While Echovirus 30 and echovirus 6 frequency was significantly higher in patients older than 3 years of age the opposite was observed for CV A16 and EV A71 which dominated in young children less than 3 years Importantly for the current study period a significant increase of previously only sporadically observed EV A types such as EV A71 and CV A16 was noted A phylogenetic analysis of EV A71 showed that the majority of the EV A71 strains from Cyprus belonged to sub genogroup C1 and C2 with the exception of one C4 strain that was observed in 2011 The data presented provide a comprehensive picture of enteroviruses circulating in Cyprus over the last decade and will be helpful to clinicians and researchers involved in the treatment prevention and control of enteroviral infections by helping interpret trends in enteroviral diseases by associating them with circulating serotypes for studying the association of enteroviruses with clinical manifestations and develop strategies for designing future EV vaccines

Acute flaccid myelitis AFM has caused motor paralysis in 560 children in the United States since 2014 The temporal association of enterovirus EV outbreaks with increases in AFM cases and reports of fever respiratory or gastrointestinal illness prior to AFM in 90 of cases suggest a role for infectious agents Cerebrospinal fluid CSF from 14 AFM and 5 non AFM patients with central nervous system CNS diseases in 2018 were investigated by viral capture high throughput sequencing VirCapSeq VERT system These CSF and serum samples as well as multiple controls were tested for antibodies to human EVs using peptide microarrays EV RNA was confirmed in CSF from only 1 adult AFM case and 1 non AFM case In contrast antibodies to EV peptides were present in CSF of 11 of 14 AFM patients 79 significantly higher than controls including non AFM patients 1 5 20 children with Kawasaki disease 0 10 and adults with non AFM CNS diseases 2 11 18

Human enteroviruses EVs are associated with a wide spectrum of human diseases Here we report the complete genome sequences of one EV C99 strain and one E29 strain obtained from children suffering from acute gastroenteritis without symptoms of enteroviral syndromes This is the first report of EV C99 in South America and the second E29 genome described worldwide Continuous surveillance on EVs is vital to provide further understanding of the circulation of new or rare EV serotypes in the country The present study also highlights the capacity of EVs to remain in silent circulation in populations

Over the past two decades there has been tremendous progress in understanding the impact of the intestinal microbiota on mammalian metabolism physiology and immune development and function There has also been substantial advancement in elucidating the interplay between commensal and pathogenic bacteria Relatively more recently researchers have begun to investigate the effect of the intestinal microbiota on viral pathogenesis Indeed a growing body of literature has reported that commensal bacteria within the mammalian intestinal tract enhance enteric virus infections through a variety of mechanisms Commensal bacteria or bacterial glycans can increase the stability of enteric viruses enhance virus binding to host receptors modulate host immune responses in a proviral manner expand the numbers of host cell targets and facilitate viral recombination In this review we will summarize the current literature exploring these effects of the intestinal microbiota on enteric virus infections

No comparison data have been reported on viral and epidemiological profiles of hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection SARI in Beijing or Shanghai China

Meningitis can be caused by several viruses and bacteria Identifying the causative pathogen as quickly as possible is crucial to initiate the most optimal therapy as acute bacterial meningitis is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality Bacterial meningitis requires antibiotics as opposed to enteroviral meningitis which only requires supportive therapy Clinical presentation is usually not sufficient to differentiate between viral and bacterial meningitis thereby necessitating cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis by PCR and or time consuming bacterial cultures However collecting CSF in children is not always feasible and a rather invasive procedure

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 causes respiratory tract infections and neurologic manifestations We compared the clinical manifestations from 2 EV D68 outbreaks in 2014 and 2018 and a low activity period in 2016 among hospitalized children in central Ohio USA and used PCR and sequencing to enable phylogenetic comparisons During both outbreak periods infected children had respiratory manifestations that led to an increase in hospital admissions for asthma The 2018 EV D68 outbreak appeared to be milder in terms of respiratory illness as shown by lower rates of pediatric intensive care unit admission However the frequency of severe neurologic manifestations was higher in 2018 than in 2014 During the same period in 2016 we noted neither an increase in EV D68 nor a significant increase in asthma related admissions Phylogenetic analyses showed that EV D68 isolates from 2018 clustered differently within clade B than did isolates from 2014 and are perhaps associated with a different EV D68 subclade

During enteroviral infections the canonical translation factor eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 γ I eIF4GI is cleaved by viral protease 2A The resulting C terminal fragment is recruited by the viral internal ribosome entry site IRES for efficient translation of the viral RNA However the 2A protease is not present in the viral capsid and is synthesized only after the initial round of translation This presents the conundrum of how the initial round of translation occurs in the absence of the C terminal eIF4GI fragment Interestingly the host protein DAP5 also known as p97 eIF4GIII and eIF4G2 an isoform of eIF4GI closely resembles the eIF4GI C terminal fragment produced after 2A protease mediated cleavage Using the Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 IRES as a model system here we demonstrate that DAP5 but not the full length eIF4GI is required for CVB3 IRES activity for translation of input viral RNA Additionally we show that DAP5 is specifically required by type I IRES but not by type II or type III IRES in which cleavage of eIF4GI has not been observed We observed that both DAP5 and C terminal eIF4GI interact with CVB3 IRES in the same region but DAP5 exhibits a lower affinity for CVB3 IRES compared with the C terminal eIF4GI fragment It appears that DAP5 is required for the initial round of viral RNA translation by sustaining a basal level of CVB3 IRES activity This activity leads to expression of 2A protease and consequent robust CVB3 IRES mediated translation by the C terminal eIF4GI fragment

It is demonstrated that carbon quantum dots derived from curcumin Cur CQDs through one step dry heating are effective antiviral agents against enterovirus 71 EV71 The surface properties of Cur CQDs as well as their antiviral activity are highly dependent on the heating temperature during synthesis The one step heating of curcumin at 180 C preserves many of the moieties of polymeric curcumin on the surfaces of the as synthesized Cur CQDs resulting in superior antiviral characteristics It is proposed that curcumin undergoes a series of structural changes through dehydration polymerization and carbonization to form core shell CQDs whose surfaces remain a pyrolytic curcumin like polymer boosting the antiviral activity The results reveal that curcumin possesses insignificant inhibitory activity against EV71 infection in RD cells half maximal effective concentration EC

Viral respiratory tract infections are common during early childhood How they impact cystic fibrosis lung disease history in young children is poorly known The principal aim of our study was to determinate respiratory tract infections frequency in this cystic fibrosis young population Secondary outcomes were nature of viral agents recovered and impact of such infections

Human enteroviruses HEVs of the family Picornaviridae which comprises non enveloped RNA viruses are ubiquitous worldwide The majority of EV proteins are derived from viral polyproteins encoded by a single open reading frame ORF Here we characterize a second ORF in HEVs that is crucial for viral intestinal infection Disruption of ORF2p expression decreases the replication capacity of EV A71 in human intestinal epithelial cells IECs Ectopic expression of ORF2p proteins derived from diverse enteric enteroviruses sensitizes intestinal cells to the replication of ORF2p defective EV A71 and respiratory enterovirus EV D68 We show that the highly conserved WIGHPV domain of ORF2p is important for ORF2p dependent viral intestinal infection ORF2p expression is required for EV A71 particle release from IECs and can support productive EV D68 infection in IECs by facilitating virus release Our results indicate that ORF2p is a determining factor for enteric enterovirus replication in IECs

Enterovirus 71 EV71 induces apoptosis to promote viral particle release Earlier work showed that EV71 utilizes its 3C protease to induce apoptosis in a caspase 3 dependent pathway though the mechanism is unknown However work from Vagner Holcik and colleagues showed that host protein heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 hnRNP A1 binds the IRES of cellular apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 apaf 1 mRNA to repress its translation In this work we show that apaf 1 expression is essential for EV71 induced apoptosis EV71 infection or ectopic expression of 3C protease cleaves hnRNP A1 which abolishes its binding to the apaf 1 IRES This allows IRES dependent synthesis of apaf 1 activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis Thus we reveal a novel mechanism that EV71 utilizes for virus release via a 3C protease hnRNP A1 apaf 1 caspase 3 apoptosis axis

Next generation sequencing NGS has been applied in the field of infectious diseases Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF is considered a sterile type of specimen that is suitable for detecting pathogens of respiratory infections The aim of this study was to comprehensively identify causative pathogens using NGS in BALF samples from immunocompetent pediatric patients with respiratory failure Ten patients hospitalized with respiratory failure were included BALF samples obtained in the acute phase were used to prepare DNA and RNA sequencing libraries The libraries were sequenced on MiSeq and the sequence data were analyzed using metagenome analysis tools A mean of 2 041 216 total reads were sequenced for each library Significant bacterial or viral sequencing reads were detected in eight of the 10 patients Furthermore candidate pathogens were detected in three patients in whom etiologic agents were not identified by conventional methods The complete genome of enterovirus D68 was identified in two patients and phylogenetic analysis suggested that both strains belong to subclade B3 which is an epidemic strain that has spread worldwide in recent years Our results suggest that NGS can be applied for comprehensive molecular diagnostics as well as surveillance of pathogens in BALF from patients with respiratory infection

Accumulating evidence suggests that intestinal bacteria promote enteric virus infection in mice For example previous work demonstrated that antibiotic treatment of mice prior to oral infection with poliovirus reduced viral replication and pathogenesis Here we examined the effect of antibiotic treatment on infection with coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 a picornavirus closely related to poliovirus We treated mice with a mixture of five antibiotics to deplete host microbiota and examined CVB3 replication and pathogenesis following oral inoculation We found that as seen with poliovirus CVB3 shedding and pathogenesis were reduced in antibiotic treated mice While treatment with just two antibiotics vancomycin and ampicillin was sufficient to reduce CVB3 replication and pathogenesis this treatment had no effect on poliovirus The quantity and composition of bacterial communities were altered by treatment with the five antibiotic cocktail and by treatment with vancomycin and ampicillin To determine whether more subtle changes in bacterial populations impact viral replication we examined viral infection in mice treated with milder antibiotic regimens Mice treated with one tenth the standard concentration of the normal antibiotic cocktail supported replication of poliovirus but not CVB3 Importantly a single dose of one antibiotic streptomycin was sufficient to reduce CVB3 shedding and pathogenesis while having no effect on poliovirus shedding and pathogenesis Overall replication and pathogenesis of CVB3 are more sensitive to antibiotic treatment than poliovirus indicating that closely related viruses may differ with respect to their reliance on microbiota

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is the major pathogen responsible for the severe hand foot and mouth disease worldwide for which few effective antiviral drugs are presently available Interferon α IFN α has been used in antiviral therapy for decades it has been reported that EV A71 antagonizes the antiviral activity of IFN α based on viral 2A

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is the major cause of severe hand foot and mouth diseases HFMD especially encephalitis and other nervous system diseases EV A71 capsid protein VP1 mediates virus attachment and is the important virulence factor in the EV A71pathogenesis In this study we explored the roles of VP1 in the permeability of blood brain barrier BBB Sera albumin Evans blue and dextran leaked into brain parenchyma of the 1 week old C57BL 6J mice intracranially injected with VP1 recombinant protein VP1 also increased the permeability of the brain endothelial cells monolayer an in vitro BBB model Tight junction protein claudin 5 was reduced in the brain tissues or brain endothelial cells treated with VP1 In contrast VP1 increased the expression of virus receptor vimentin which could be blocked with VP1 neutralization antibody Vimentin expression in the VP1 treated brain endothelial cells was regulated by TGF β Smad 3 and NF κB signal pathways Moreover vimentin over expression was accompanied with compromised BBB From these studies we conclude that EV A71 virus capsid protein VP1 disrupted BBB and increased virus receptor vimentin which both may contribute to the virus entrance into brain and EV A71 CNS infection

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is a respiratory viral pathogen that primarily infects children under the age of 8 Although EV D68 infection typically leads to moderate to severe respiratory illnesses recent years have seen increasing cases of EV D68 triggered neurological complications such as acute flaccid myelitis AFM There is currently no vaccine or antiviral available for EV D68 we therefore aimed to develop potent and specific small molecule antivirals against EV D68 In this study we report our discovery of a viral capsid inhibitor

Viral myocarditis is potentially fatal and lacking a specific treatment Exosomes secreted by cardiac progenitor cells CPCs have emerged as a promising tool for cardioprotection and repair In this study we investigated whether CPCs derived exosomes CPCs Ex could utilize the mTOR signal pathway to reduce the apoptosis in viral myocarditis In vitro exosomes were respectively added to H9C2 cells after CVB3 infection to detect the anti apoptosis effect of CPCs Ex Compared with the controls the apoptosis rate was reduced accompanied with the depressed expression of viral capsid protein 1 VP1 and pro apoptosis factors of Bim caspase families Meanwhile the phosphorylation of Akt mTOR and p70S6K were promoted but that of 4EBP1 was suppressed In vivo the results of apoptosis expression of CVB3 and pro apoptosis factors and phosphorylation of Akt mTOR factors of CVB3 infected cardiomyocytes were consistent with that of vitro Following that we use Rapamycin and MK 2206 to inhibit the Akt mTOR signaling pathway meanwhile Rattus 4EBP1 p70S6K Akt1 and Akt2 were transfected to H9C2 cells to establish the stably transfected cell lines In the group with Rapamycin or MK 2206 pretreatment CPCs Ex also could decrease the apoptosis of H9C2 cells and expression of CVB3 mRNA followed by decreased expression of apoptosis factors In Akt2 p70S6K and 4EBP1 overexpression groups CPCs Ex promoted CVB3 induced apoptosis VP1 expression and cleavage of caspase 3 Our results therefore identify CPCs Ex exerts an anti apoptosis effect in CVB3 infected cells by abrogating the proliferation of CVB3 and modulating the mTOR signaling pathways as well as the expression of Bcl 2 and caspase families Viral myocarditis mainly caused by CVB3 infection is lacking a specific treatment Our study identified an anti apoptosis role of CPCs Ex in CVB3 infected cells and rats which shown that CPCs Ex may be an effective tool to treat viral myocarditis We believe that with more in depth research on the functionality of CPCs Ex there will be a breakthrough in the treatment of viral myocarditis

Sporadic outbreaks caused by coxsackievirus A4 CV A4 have been reported worldwide To further elucidate the detailed genetic characteristics and evolutionary recombination events of CV A4 virus samples from nationwide hand foot and mouth disease HFMD surveillance encompassing 27 out of the 31 provinces in China were investigated Comprehensive and systematic phylogenetic analyses were performed by using 29 complete genomes 142 complete CV A4 VP1 sequences Four genotypes A B C and D and five sub genotypes C1 C5 were re identified based on the complete VP1 sequences C2 is the predominant sub genotype of CV A4 associated with HFMD and has evolved into 3 clusters Cluster 1 is a major cluster that has been persistently and extensively circulating in China since 2006 and has been associated with all severe cases All the sequences showed high homology with the CV A4 prototype in the P1 region while higher identities with CV A5 CV 14 and CV 16 in the P2 and P3 regions Recombination analysis revealed that C2 had two specific genetic recombination patterns with other EV A prototypes in the 5 UTR and 3D region compared with C5 These recombination patterns might be associated with the increased transmissibility of C2 viruses which were obtained due to their persistent and extensive circulation in populations

Neurovirulent enterovirus 71 EV A71 caused a massive epidemic in China in 2008 2011 While subgenotype C4 was the major causative agent a few isolates were almost identical to the prototype EV A71 strain and belonged to genotype A This variant was allegedly extinct since 1970 and its identification in this epidemic suggests reintroduction of the archive virus Regression analysis of genetic distances TempEst software was of moderate utility due to the low resolution of classical phylogenetic methods Bayesian phylogenetic analysis BEAST software suggested artificial introduction event based on highly aberrant phylogenetic tree branch rates that differed by over three standard deviations from the mean substitution rate for EV71 Manual nucleotide level analysis was used to further explore the virus spread pattern after introduction into circulation Upon reintroduction the virus accumulated up to seven substitutions in VP1 most of them non synonymous and located within the capsid s canyon or at its rims compatible with readaptation of a lab strain to natural circulation

To enhance our ability to monitor poliovirus circulation and certify eradication we evaluated the performance of the bag mediated filtration system BMFS against the two phase separation TPS method for concentrating wastewater samples for poliovirus detection Sequential samples were collected at two sites in Mexico one L was collected by grab and 5 L were collected and filtered in situ with the BMFS In the laboratory 500 mL collected by grab were concentrated using TPS and the sample contained in the filter of the BMFS was eluted without secondary concentration Concentrates were tested for the presence of poliovirus and non poliovirus enterovirus NPEV using Global Poliovirus Laboratory Network standard procedures Between February 16 2016 and April 18 2017 125 pairs of samples were obtained Collectors spent an average standard deviation of 4 3 2 2 min collecting the TPS sample versus 73 5 30 5 min collecting and filtering the BMFS sample Laboratory processing required an estimated 5 h for concentration by TPS and 3 5 h for elution Sabin 1 poliovirus was detected in 37 30 samples with the TPS versus 24 19 samples with the BMFS McNemar s mid p value 0 004 Sabin 3 poliovirus was detected in 59 47 versus 49 39 samples p 0 043 and NPEV was detected in 67 54 versus 40 32 samples p 0 001 The BMFS method without secondary concentration did not perform as well as the TPS method for detecting Sabin poliovirus and NPEV Further studies are needed to guide the selection of cost effective environmental surveillance methods for the polio endgame

During 2014 enterovirus D68 EV D68 outbreaks were described globally causing severe respiratory diseases in children and in some cases subsequent paralysis In this study the type characterization of enterovirus EV detected in respiratory illnesses and the epidemiology and clinical association of EV D68 infections in Spain over a five year period were described A total of 546 EV positive samples from hospitalized patients with respiratory infections were included EV D68 was the most frequently detected type 46 6 191 410 typed EV Other EV from species A 25 1 B 27 8 and C 0 5 were also identified EV D68 infections were more associated with bronchitis while EV A B types were more frequent in upper respiratory illness

The P38 mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK pathway plays an essential role in CVB3 induced diseases We previously demonstrated microRNA 21 has potential inhibitory effect on the MAP2K3 which locates upstream of P38 MAPK and was upregulated in mouse hearts upon CVB3 infection However the effect and underlying mechanism of miRNA 21 on CVB3 infection remain unclear

The coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 mouse myocarditis model is the standard model for investigation of virus induced myocarditis but the pancreas rather than the heart is the most susceptible organ in mouse The aim of this study was to develop a CVB3 mouse myocarditis model in which animals develop myocarditis while attenuating viral infection of the pancreas and the development of severe pancreatitis

Some viruses are released from cells as pools of membrane associated virions By increasing the multiplicity of infection MOI this type of collective dispersal could favor viral cooperation but also the emergence of cheater like viruses such as defective interfering particles To better understand this process we examined the genetic diversity of membrane associated coxsackievirus infectious units We find that infected cells release membranous structures including vesicles that contain 8 21 infectious particles on average However in most cases 62 93 these structures do not promote the co transmission of different viral genetic variants present in a cell Furthermore collective dispersal has no effect on viral population sequence diversity Our results indicate that membrane associated collective infectious units typically contain viral particles derived from the same parental genome Hence if cooperation occurs it should probably involve sibling viral particles rather than different variants As shown by social evolution theory cooperation among siblings should be robust against cheater invasion

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD remains a burdensome health issue in mainland China Enterovirus71 EV A71 is the main pathogen of severe HFMD Continuous hemofiltration improves fluid overload restores kidney function and alleviates inflammatory reactions The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of continuous veno venous hemodiafiltration CVVHDF on severe HFMD caused by EV A71 EV A71 HFMD in a pediatric intensive care unit PICU

Early diagnosis and treatment of meningitis and encephalitis is essential for reducing both their morbidity and mortality The FilmArray Meningitis Encephalitis FA M E panel is a recently available molecular tool allowing the simultaneous detection of 14 pathogens in about one hour We evaluated its routine use over a 13 month period at Nîmes University Hospital France Cerebrospinal fluid CSF specimens were prospectively analyzed independently of cell count results were retrospectively analyzed and positive results compared to clinical and microbiological data Among the 708 patients included 734 CSF samples 89 12 6 had a positive FA M E panel 71 80 for a viral pathogen and 18 20 for a bacterial pathogen Enterovirus and HHV 6 were the main detected pathogens Mean time to results was 1h46mn Four non clinically relevant results were detected 3 HHV 6 and 1 Haemophilus influenzae on the basis of inconsistent clinical and or biological data and or after visualization of melting curves No CSF pleocytosis was observed in 11 of the patients with a positive FA M E panel For the 18 patients with a positive FA M E panel for a bacterial pathogen five 28 had CSF samples showing a positive Gram stain allowing an early diagnosis of bacterial infection and 67 had CSF displaying a positive culture Altogether the panel detected 5 cases of bacterial M E 29 not diagnosed by culture Despite undeniable advantages mainly ease of use quick result availability and an extremely low rate of invalid results measures should be implemented to limit false positive results due to contamination and a careful interpretation based on the overall data for each patient is required

As a disease characterized by severe liver necrosis and hemorrhage duck viral hepatitis DVH is mainly caused by duck hepatitis A virus DHAV The positive strand RNA genome of DHAV type 1 DHAV 1 contains an internal ribosome entry site IRES element within the 5 untranslated region UTR structured sequence elements within the 3 UTR and a poly A tail at the 3 terminus In this study we first examined that insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 IGF2BP1 specifically interacted with the DHAV 1 3 UTR by RNA pull down assay The interaction between IGF2BP1 and DHAV 1 3 UTR strongly enhanced IRES mediated translation efficiency but failed to regulate DHAV 1 replication in a duck embryo epithelial DEE cell line The viral propagation of DHAV 1 strongly enhanced IGF2BP1 expression level and viral protein accumulation was identified as the key point to this increment Collectively our data demonstrated the positive role of IGF2BP1 in DHAV 1 viral proteins translation and provided data support for the replication mechanism of DHAV 1

Conventional assays to titrate polioviruses usually test serial dilutions inoculated into replicate cell cultures to determine a 50 cytopathic endpoint a process that is both time consuming and laborious Such a method is still used to measure potency of live Oral Poliovirus Vaccine during vaccine development and production and in some clinical trials However the conventional method is not suited to identify and titrate virus in the large numbers of fecal samples generated during clinical trials Determining titers of each of the three Sabin strains co existing in Oral Poliovirus Vaccine presents an additional challenge

Coxsackievirus B CVB is the major cause of human myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy Toll like receptor 3 TLR3 is an intracellular sensor to detect pathogen s dsRNA TLR3 along with TRAF6 triggers an inflammatory response through NF κB signaling pathway In the cells infected with CVB type 3 CVB3 the abundance of miR 146a was significantly increased The role of miR 146a in CVB infection is unclear In this study TLR3 and TRAF6 were identified as the targets of miR 146a The elevated miR 146a inhibited NF κB translocation and subsequently down regulated proinflammatory cytokine expression in the CVB3 infected cells Therefore the NF κB pathway can be doubly blocked by miR 146a through targeting of TLR3 and TRAF6 MiR 146a may be a negative regulator on inflammatory response and an intrinsic protective factor in CVB infection

Statistical phylogenetic methods are a powerful tool for inferring the evolutionary history of viruses through time and space The selection of mathematical models and analysis parameters has a major impact on the outcome and has been relatively well described in the literature The preparation of a sequence dataset is less formalized but its impact can be even more profound This article used simulated datasets of enterovirus sequences to evaluate the effect of sample bias on picornavirus phylogenetic studies Possible approaches to the reduction of large datasets and their potential for introducing additional artefacts were demonstrated The most consistent results were obtained using smart sampling which reduced sequence subsets from large studies more than those from smaller ones in order to preserve the rare sequences in a dataset The effect of sequences with technical or annotation errors in the Bayesian framework was also analyzed Sequences with about 0 5 sequencing errors or incorrect isolation dates altered by just 5 years could be detected by various approaches but the efficiency of identification depended upon sequence position in a phylogenetic tree Even a single erroneous sequence could profoundly destabilize the whole analysis by increasing the variance of the inferred evolutionary parameters

In China pertussis is a major health problem with an increasing incidence despite immunization efforts Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for the optimal management of pertussis especially in severe cases

Human enteroviruses and human parechoviruses are associated with a broad range of diseases and even severe and fatal conditions For human cosaviruses the etiological role is yet unknown Little is known about the circulation of non polio enteroviruses human parechoviruses and human cosaviruses in Nigeria A total of 113 stool samples were collected from healthy individuals in Osun State between February 2016 and May 2017 RT PCR assays targeting the 5 non coding region 5 NCR were used to screen for human enteroviruses human parechoviruses and human cosaviruses For human enteroviruses species specific RT PCR assays targeting the VP1 regions were used for molecular typing Inoculation was carried out on RD A CaCo 2 HEp 2C and L20B cell lines to compare molecular and virological assays Ten samples tested positive for enterovirus RNA with 11 strains detected including CV A13

Rhinovirus C is an important pathogen of asthmatic and non asthmatic children hospitalised with episodic wheeze Previous studies on other respiratory viruses have shown that several host cytokines correlate with duration of hospitalisation but this has yet to be investigated in children with RV C infection We determined the nasal cytokine profiles of these children and investigated their relationship with RV C load and clinical outcome Flocked nasal swabs were collected from children aged 24 72 months presenting to the Emergency Department at Princess Margaret Hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute wheeze and an acute upper respiratory tract viral infection RV C load was determined by quantitative RT PCR and cytokine profiles were characterised by a commercial human cytokine 34 plex panel RV C was the most commonly detected virus in pre school aged children hospitalised with an episodic wheeze RV C load did not significantly differ between asthmatic and non asthmatic patients Both groups showed a Th2 based cytokine profile However Th17 response cytokines IL 17 and IL 1β were only elevated in RV C infected children with pre existing asthma Neither RV C load nor any specific cytokines were associated illness severity in this study Medically attended RV C induced wheeze is characterised by a Th2 inflammatory pattern independent of viral load Any therapeutic interventions should be aimed at modulating the host response following infection

We describe DAMIAN an open source bioinformatics tool designed for the identification of pathogenic microorganisms in diagnostic samples By using authentic clinical samples and comparing our results to those from established analysis pipelines as well as conventional diagnostics we demonstrate that DAMIAN rapidly identifies pathogens in different diagnostic entities and accurately classifies viral agents down to the strain level We furthermore show that DAMIAN is able to assemble full length viral genomes even in samples co infected with multiple virus strains an ability which is of considerable advantage for the investigation of outbreak scenarios While DAMIAN similar to other pipelines analyzes single samples to perform classification of sequences according to their likely taxonomic origin it also includes a tool for cohort based analysis This tool uses cross sample comparisons to identify sequence signatures that are frequently present in a sample group of interest e g a disease associated cohort but occur less frequently in control cohorts As this approach does not require homology searches in databases it principally allows the identification of not only known but also completely novel pathogens Using samples from a meningitis outbreak we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in identifying enterovirus as the causative agent

Human viruses are ubiquitous contaminants in surface waters where they can persist over extended periods of time Among the factors governing their environmental persistence the control removal or inactivation by microorganisms remains poorly understood Here we determined the contribution of indigenous bacteria and protists to the decay of human viruses in surface waters Incubation of echovirus 11 E11 in freshwater from Lake Geneva and seawater from the Mediterranean Sea led to a 2 5 log

Oral rotavirus vaccines RVVs are less efficacious in low income versus high income settings plausibly due to more enteropathogen exposure through poor water sanitation and hygiene WASH We explored associations between enteropathogens and RVV immunogenicity and evaluated the effect of improved WASH on enteropathogen carriage

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 and coxsackievirus A16 CV A16 are the most common causes of hand foot and mouth disease Severe EV A71 and CV A16 infections may be associated with life threatening complications However the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these severe clinical and pathological features remain incompletely understood Lipids are known to play critical roles in multiple stages of the virus replication cycle The specific lipid profile induced upon virus infection is required for optimal virus replication The perturbations in the host cell lipidomic profiles upon enterovirus infection have not been fully characterized To this end we performed ultra high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry UPLC ESI Q TOF MS based lipidomics to characterize the change in host lipidome upon EV A71 and CV A16 infections Our results revealed that 47 lipids within 11 lipid classes were significantly perturbed after EV A71 and CV A16 infection Four polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs namely arachidonic acid AA docosahexaenoic acid DHA docosapentaenoic acid DPA and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA were consistently upregulated upon EV A71 and CV A16 infection Importantly exogenously supplying three of these four PUFAs including AA DHA and EPA in cell cultures significantly reduced EV A71 and CV A16 replication Taken together our results suggested that enteroviruses might specifically modulate the host lipid pathways for optimal virus replication Excessive exogenous addition of lipids that disrupted this delicate homeostatic state could prevent efficient viral replication Precise manipulation of the host lipid profile might be a potential host targeting antiviral strategy for enterovirus infection

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus PEDV is an emerging and re emerging epizootic virus of swine that causes substantial economic losses to the pig industry in China and other countries The variations in the virus and its co infections with other enteric viruses have contributed to the poor control of PEDV infection In the current study a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in 22 provinces or municipalities of China during 2015 2018 The enteric viruses causing co infection with PEDV and the genetic diversity of the PEDV S1 gene were also analysed The results indicated that of the 543 diarrhoea samples 66 85 363 543 were positive for PEDV and co infection rates of PEDV with 13 enteric viruses ranged from 3 58 13 363 to 81 55 296 363 Among these enteric viruses the signs of diarrhoea induced by PEDV were potentially associated with co infections with porcine enterovirus 9 10 PEV and torque teno sus virus 2 TTSuV 2 p 05 The 147 PEDV strains identified in our study belong to Chinese pandemic strains and exhibited genetic diversity The virulence determining S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic strains were undergoing amino acid mutations in which S58_S58insQGVN N135dup D158_I159del like mutations were common patterns 97 28 143 147 When compared with 2011 2014 PEDV strains the amino acid mutations of PEDV pandemic strains were mainly located in the N terminal domain of S1 S1 NTD and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018 Furthermore protein homology modelling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations of the S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the surface of the S1 protein These data provide a better understanding of the co infection and genetic evolution of PEDV in China

The most recent documented Australian outbreak of enterovirus A71 EV A71 occurred in Sydney from 2012 to 2013 Over a four month period more than 100 children presented to four paediatric hospitals with encephalitic presentations including fever and myoclonic jerks The heterogeneous presentations included typical encephalomyelitis and cardiopulmonary complications

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is one of the major causative agents of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in the world infecting mostly infants and young children 5 years of age in Asia Approximately 2 million cases of HFMD were reported in China each year of which approximately 45 50 were due to EV A71 Most of the HFMD infections caused by EV A71 usually result in mild symptoms with rashes and ulcers in the mouth However virulent strains of EV A71 can infect the central nervous system and cause severe neurologic diseases leading to reduced cognitive ability acute flaccid paralysis and death The lack of understanding of cellular immunity for long term protection from the HFMD disease represents a major obstacle for vaccine development In particular the role of innate and T cell immunity during HFMD infection remains unclear and there is evidence suggesting the importance of CD4

Diarrhoea is a major cause of death in neonate pigs and most of the viruses that cause it are RNA viruses Next Generation Sequencing NGS deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level The diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms plus 4 samples from non diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by NGS Samples were selected among the cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Barcelona Spain and Universidad de León León Spain

Coxsackievirus A6 CV A6 has been associated with increasingly occurred sporadic hand foot mouth disease HFMD cases and outbreak events in many countries In order to understand epidemiological characteristics of CV A6 we collected the information describing HFMD caused by CV A6 to describe the detection rate severe rate and onychomadesis rate which is defined as one or more nails defluvium caused by CV A6 from 2007 to 2017 The results showed that there was an outbreak of CV A6 every other year and overall trend of the epidemic of CA6 associated HFMD was increasing in China The detection rate of CV A6 in other countries was 32 0 95 CI 25 0 40 0 before 2013 and 28 0 95 CI 20 0 36 0 after 2013 respectively Although the severe rate of HFMD caused by CV A6 was low 0 10 95 CI 0 01 0 20 CV A6 can cause a high incidence of onychomadesis 28 0 95 CI 21 9 34 3 Thus it would be worthwhile to research and develop an effective multivalent vaccine for CV A6 to achieve a more powerful prevention of HMFD

Enterovirus 71 EV71 can invade the central nervous system CNS and cause neurological disease Accumulating evidence indicates that EV71 can directly infect neurons in the CNS Innate immune responses in the CNS have been known to play an essential role in limiting pathogen infections Thus investigating the effects of EV71 infection of neural cells is important for understanding disease pathogenesis In this study human neural cells were infected with EV71 and interferonβ IFNβ expression was examined Our results show that IFNβ expression was upregulated in EV71 infected neural cells via pattern recognition receptors PRRs sensing of virus RNA The PRRs Toll like receptor 3 TLR3 Toll like receptor 8 TLR8 and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 MDA 5 but not retinoic acid inducible gene I RIG I and Toll like receptor 7 TLR7 were found to be EV71 mediated IFNβ induction Although viral proteins exhibited the ability to cleave mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS and Toll IL 1 receptor TIR domain containing adaptor inducing IFN β TRIF in neural cells levels of viral protein expression were low in these cells Furthermore neural cells efficiently produced IFNβ transcripts upon EV71 vRNA stimulation Treating infected cells with anti IFNβ antibodies resulted in increased virus replication indicating that IFNβ release may play a role in limiting viral growth These results indicate that EV71 infection can induce IFNβ expression in neural cells through PRR pathways

Viruses in species

Viruses are the main cause of respiratory tract infections Metagenomic next generation sequencing mNGS enables unbiased detection of all potential pathogens To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses is needed Herein were studied the performance of an in house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections with potential for automated pan pathogen detection The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized including exogenous internal controls Subsequently the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information s RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information s nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value Sensitivity of mNGS compared with PCR varied up to 83 with specificity of 94 dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS not present in the routine diagnostic workflow were influenza C KI polyomavirus cytomegalovirus and enterovirus Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol were comparable to PCR and higher when considering off PCR target viral pathogens One single test detected all potential viral pathogens and simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 infection is known to cause hand foot and mouth disease HFMD Last year an inactivated EV A71 whole virus vaccine was used to prevent this disease in Yunnan China To obtain a viral genetic background for evaluating vaccine protection and monitor the adaptive evolution of the virus after the vaccination a 5 year molecular epidemiology survey was performed before the vaccination Twenty six EV A71 strains were separated from 561 stool specimens of patients with serious HFMD The whole genomic sequences of these strains were sequenced Phylogenetic trees were constructed and the mutation spectra were analyzed based on these viral sequences There was no obvious mutation for the circular EV A71 strains of the same year Pathogenic EV A71 strains may arise from a subgroup randomly each year Whole genomic analyses showed that a hotspot nonsynonymous substitution potentially affecting the immunogenicity of vaccines was found in the 2A gene but not in genes of the viral capsid proteins and the genetic diversity of whole viral genomes associated with the incidence of HFMD Therefore it will be valuable to monitor the genome wide changes of EV A71 to detect the adaptive mutations affecting immunogenicity or perform investigations using genetic diversity as a parameter

Coxsackievirus A10 CV A10 has recently emerged as a major pathogen of hand foot and mouth disease in children worldwide Currently no effective treatments are available development of anti CV A10 vaccine is a most cost effective way for CV A10 prevention Robust assay to measure neutralizing antibody NtAb titres elicited by vaccination would greatly prompt anti CV A10 vaccine development Compare to the traditional neutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effects herein after referred to as cNT which is time consuming and labor intensive in this study we developed an efficient high throughput neutralization antibody assay based on CV A10 pseudoviruses herein after referred to as pNT In the pNT anti CV A10 NtAb titre was negatively corresponded with the relative luminescent unit RLU produced by luciferase reporter gene incorporated in pseudovirus genome As described in this study the NtAb against CV A10 could be detected within 10 16 h anti CV A10 NtAb in 67 human serum samples were measured in parallel with pNT and cNT assays a good correlation r 0 83

Molecular testing of cerebrospinal fluid CSF using the BioFire FilmArray meningitis encephalitis FA M E panel permits rapid simultaneous pathogen detection Due to the broad spectrum of targeted organisms FA M E testing may be restricted to patients with abnormal CSF findings We sought to determine if restriction is appropriate in our previously healthy and or immunocompromised pediatric patients FA M E was ordered on 1 025 CSF samples from 948 patients 121 11 8 specimens were FA M E positive Of these 89 73 6 were virus positive and 30 24 8 were bacterium positive The most common targets detected were enterovirus

Enteric viruses infect the gastrointestinal tract and bacteria can promote replication and transmission of several enteric viruses Viruses can be inactivated by exposure to heat or bleach but poliovirus coxsackievirus B3 and reovirus can be stabilized by bacteria or bacterial polysaccharides limiting inactivation and aiding transmission We previously demonstrated that certain

Enterovirus 71 EV71 the major cause of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD has evolved diverse strategies to counter the type I interferon IFN I response during infection Recently microRNAs have regulatory roles in host innate immune responses to viral infections however whether EV71 escapes the IFN I antiviral response through regulation of miRNAs remains unclear Using a microarray assay microRNA 155 5p miR 155 5p was found to be significantly up regulated in serum from patients with EV71 infection and the increased expression of miR 155 5p was further confirmed

In May 2018 Children s Hospital Colorado noted an outbreak of enterovirus A71 EV A71 neurological disease We aimed to characterise the clinical features of EV A71 neurological disease during this outbreak

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is the main pathogen that causes severe hand foot and mouth disease with fatal neurological complications However its neurovirulence mechanism is still unclear Candidate virulence sites were screened out at structural protein VP1 but the function of these candidate virulence sites remains unclear Several studies have shown that autophagy is associated with viral replication However the relationship between VP1 and autophagy in human neurons has not been studied

The enterovirus 71 EV71 3Dpol is an RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRP that plays the central role in the viral genome replication and is an important target in antiviral studies Here we report a crystal structure of EV71 3Dpol elongation complex EC at 1 8 Å resolution The structure reveals that the 5 end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions and these interactions are still maintained after one in crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA When mutated residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding EC stability but not polymerase catalytic rate kcat and apparent NTP affinity KM NTP We propose that although rarely captured by crystallography similar surface pocket interaction with nucleobase may commonly exist in nucleic acid motor enzymes to facilitate their processivity Potential applications in antiviral drug and vaccine development are also discussed

Enterovirus 71 EV71 infection causes hand foot mouth disease HFMD meningoencephalitis neonatal sepsis and even fatal encephalitis in children thereby presenting a serious risk to public health It is important to determine the mechanisms underlying the regulation of EV71 infection In this study we initially show that the interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 ILF2 reduces EV71 50 tissue culture infective dose TCID50 and attenuates EV71 plaque formation unit PFU thereby repressing EV71 infection Microarray data analyses show that ILF2 mRNA is reduced upon EV71 infection Cellular studies indicate that EV71 infection represses ILF2 mRNA expression and protein production in human leukemic monocytes THP 1 differentiated macrophages and human rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells In addition EV71 nonstructural protein 2B interacts with ILF2 in human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells Interestingly in the presence of EV71 2B ILF2 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and it colocalizes with 2B in the cytoplasm Therefore we present a distinct mechanism by which EV71 antagonizes ILF2 mediated antiviral effects by inhibiting ILF2 expression and promoting ILF2 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through its 2B protein

Today there are no medicines to treat enterovirus and rhinovirus infections In the present study a series of novel pleconaril derivatives with substitutions in the isoxazole and phenyl rings was synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral activity against a panel of pleconaril sensitive and resistant enteroviruses Studies of the structure activity relationship demonstrate the crucial role of the N N dimethylcarbamoyl group in the isoxazole ring for antiviral activity against pleconaril resistant viruses In addition one or two substituents in the phenyl ring directly impact on the spectrum of antienteroviral activity The 3 3 methyl 4 3 3 N N dimethylcarbamoyl isoxazol 5 yl propoxy phenyl 5 trifluoromethyl 1 2 4 oxadiazole 10g was among the compounds exhibiting the strongest activity against pleconaril resistant as well as pleconaril susceptible enteroviruses with IC

Polymerase chain reaction PCR detection has become the gold standard for diagnosis and typing of enterovirus EV and human parechovirus HPeV infections Its effectiveness depends critically on using the appropriate sample types and high assay sensitivity as viral loads in cerebrospinal fluid samples from meningitis and sepsis clinical presentation can be extremely low This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of currently used commercial and in house diagnostic and typing assays Accurately quantified RNA transcript controls were distributed to 27 diagnostic and 12 reference laboratories in 17 European countries for blinded testing Transcripts represented the four human EV species EV A71 echovirus 30 coxsackie A virus 21 and EV D68 HPeV3 and specificity controls Reported results from 48 in house and 15 commercial assays showed 98 detection frequencies of high copy 1000 RNA copies 5 µL transcripts In house assays showed significantly greater detection frequencies of the low copy 10 copies 5 µL EV and HPeV transcripts 81 and 86 respectively compared with commercial assays 56 50 P 7 10

Enterovirus 71 EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 CA16 are the two main etiological agents of Hand Foot and Mouth Disease HFMD Simple and rapid detection of EV71 and CA16 is critical in resource limited settings

Enteroviruses cause a range of human and animal diseases some life threatening but there remain no licenced anti enterovirus drugs However a benzene sulfonamide derivative and related compounds have been shown recently to block infection of a range of enteroviruses by binding the capsid at a positively charged surface depression conserved across many enteroviruses It has also been established that glutathione is essential for the assembly of many enteroviruses interacting with the capsid proteins to facilitate the formation of the pentameric assembly intermediate although the mechanism is unknown Here we show by high resolution structure analyses of enterovirus F3 that reduced glutathione binds to the same interprotomer pocket as the benzene sulfonamide derivative Bound glutathione makes strong interactions with adjacent protomers thereby explaining the underlying biological role of this druggable binding pocket and delineating the pharmacophore for potential antivirals

Coxsackievirus A10 CV A10 is responsible for an escalating number of severe infections in children but no prophylactics or therapeutics are currently available KREMEN1 KRM1 is the entry receptor for the largest receptor group of hand foot and mouth disease causing viruses which includes CV A10 We report here structures of CV A10 mature virus alone and in complex with KRM1 as well as of the CV A10 A particle The receptor spans the viral canyon with a large footprint on the virus surface The footprint has some overlap with that seen for the neonatal Fc receptor complexed with enterovirus E6 but is larger and distinct from that of another enterovirus receptor SCARB2 Reduced occupancy of a particle stabilising pocket factor in the complexed virus and the presence of both unbound and expanded virus particles suggests receptor binding initiates a cascade of conformational changes that produces expanded particles primed for viral uncoating

Enteroviruses are the most common etiological agent for viral encephalitis but it is uncertain whether the cytokines have the ability to differentiate enteroviral meningitis EVM from bacterial meningitis BM

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is a common cause of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and rarely causes severe neurological disease This study aimed to elucidate the epidemiological and genetic characteristics and virulence of EV A71 strains isolated from children diagnosed with HFMD Rectal and throat swabs were collected from 488 children with HFMD in Hanoi Vietnam in 2015 2016 From 391 EV positive patients 15 EVs including coxsackievirus A6 CV A6 47 1 and EV A71 32 5 n 127 were identified Of the 127 EV A71 strains 117 92 1 were the B5 subgenotype and 10 7 9 were the C4 subgenotype A whole genome analysis of EV A71 strains showed that seven of the eight C4a strains isolated in 2016 formed a new lineage including two possible recombinants between EV A71 C4 and CV A8 The proportion of inpatients among C4 infected children was higher than among B5 infected children 80 0 vs 27 4 P 0 002 The virulence of EV A71 strains was examined in human scavenger receptor class B2 hSCARB2 transgenic mice and EV A71 C4 strains exhibited higher mortality than B5 strains 80 0 vs 30 0 P 0 0001 Thus a new EV A71 C4a lineage including two possible recombinants between EV A71 C4 and CV A8 appeared in 2016 in Vietnam The EV A71 C4 subgenotype may be more virulent than the B5 subgenotype

Coxsackievirus A9 CVA9 is an enterically transmitted enterovirus and one of the most pathogenic type among human enteroviruses CVA9 isolates use a distinctive RGD Arg Gly Asp motif within VP1 capsid protein that defines its ability to bind to integrin receptor s for cellular entry To investigate CVA9 evolution and pathogenicity genetic relationships and recombination events were analyzed between 54 novel clinical isolates of CVA9 as well as 21 previously published full length CVA9 sequences from GenBank Samples were investigated by partial sequencing of the novel VP1 and 3Dpol genes as well as including the corresponding areas from GenBank sequences Phylogenetic analyses were combined with clinical data in a further attempt to analyze whether sequence evolution reflects CVA9 pathogenicity in the phylogenies Furthermore VP1 gene was also analyzed for receptor binding sites including the RGD motif and the putative heparan sulfate HS site Analysis of the 559 nucleotide long VP1 sequences identified six clades Although most of the strains within each clade showed geographical clustering the grouping pattern of the isolates in the analysis of the VP1 gene was strikingly different from grouping of 3Dpol which suggests that recombination events may have occurred in the region encoding the nonstructural proteins Inclusion of clinical data did not provide any evidence of symptom based phylogenetic clustering of CVA9 isolates Amino acid sequence analysis of the VP1 polypeptide demonstrated that the RGD motif was fully conserved among the isolates while the putative HS binding site was only found in one isolate These data suggest that integrin binding is essential for virus tropism but do not explain the symptom repertoire

Nearly 20 years after the year 2000 target for global wild poliovirus WPV eradication live polioviruses continue to circulate with all three serotypes posing challenges for the polio endgame We updated a global differential equation based poliovirus transmission and stochastic risk model to include programmatic and epidemiological experience through January 2020 We used the model to explore the likely dynamics of poliovirus transmission for 2019 2023 which coincides with a new Global Polio Eradication Initiative Strategic Plan The model stratifies the global population into 72 blocks each containing 10 subpopulations of approximately 10 7 million people Exported viruses go into subpopulations within the same block and within groups of blocks that represent large preferentially mixing geographical areas e g continents We assign representative World Bank income levels to the blocks along with polio immunization and transmission assumptions which capture some of the heterogeneity across countries while still focusing on global poliovirus transmission dynamics We also updated estimates of reintroduction risks using available evidence The updated model characterizes transmission dynamics and resulting polio cases consistent with the evidence through 2019 Based on recent epidemiological experience and prospective immunization assumptions for the 2019 2023 Strategic Plan the updated model does not show successful eradication of serotype 1 WPV by 2023 or successful cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine serotype 2 related viruses

To characterize the clinical course and outcome of children with status asthmaticus SA admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit PICU METHODS All patients with SA who were admitted to a PICU from January 2003 to December 2018 were reviewed Polymerase chain reaction PCR studies on nasopharyngeal aspirate for respiratory pathogens were performed from 2014 to 2018

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a common childhood illness caused by enteroviruses We analyzed the pathogenic characteristics of HFMD in Shaanxi province China during 2010 2016 Clinical samples were collected from HFMD cases Real time PCR and RT PCR were used to identify the enterovirus EVs serotypes Viral RNA sequences were amplified using RT PCR and compared by phylogenetic analysis Descriptive epidemiological methods were used to analyze A total of 16 832 HFMD positive cases were confirmed in the laboratory EV A71 and CV A16 were the main pathogens in 2010 EV A71 was the dominant pathogen in the periods of 2011 to 2012 and 2014 2016 In 2013 and 2015 other EVs increased greatly in which CV A6 was the predominant pathogen EV A71 was more frequently detected in deaths and severe cases Phylogenetic analysis revealed that EV A71 belonged to the C4a evolution branch of C4 sub genotype and CV A16 belonged to the B1a or B1b evolution branch of B1 sub genotype whereas CV A6 strains were assigned to D2 or D3 sub genotype The pathogen spectrum of HFMD has changed in 7 years and the major serotypes EV A71 CV A16 and CV A6 alternated or co circulated Long term surveillance and research of EVs should be strengthened for the prevention and control of HFMD

Foot and mouth disease virus FMDV is one of the most notorious pathogens in the global livestock industry To establish an infection FMDV needs to counteract host antiviral responses Several studies have shown how FMDV suppresses the type I interferon IFN response however whether FMDV modulates the integrated autophagy and innate immunity remains largely unknown Here the porcine Ras GAP SH3 binding protein 1 G3BP1 was shown to promote the retinoic acid inducible gene I RIG I like helicase RLH signaling by upregulating the expression of RIG I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 MDA5 FMDV nonstructural protein 3A interacted with G3BP1 to inhibit G3BP1 expression and G3BP1 mediated RLH signaling by upregulating the expression of autophagy related protein LRRC25 In addition 3A proteins of other picornaviruses including Seneca Valley virus SVV 3A enterovirus 71 EV71 3A and encephalomyocarditis virus EMCV 3A also showed similar actions Taking the data together we elucidated for the first time a novel mechanism by which FMDV has evolved to inhibit IFN signaling and counteract host innate antiviral responses by autophagy

A concerted action on the part of international agencies and national governments has resulted in the near eradication of poliomyelitis However both the oral polio vaccine OPV and the inactivated polio vaccine IPV have deficiencies which make them suboptimal for use after global eradication OPV is composed of attenuated Sabin strains and stimulates robust immunity but may revert to neurovirulent forms in the intestine which can be shed and infect susceptible contacts The majority of IPV products are manufactured using pathogenic strains inactivated with formalin Upon eradication the production of large quantities of pathogenic virus will present an increased biosecurity hazard A logical ideal endgame vaccine would be an inactivated form of an attenuated strain that could afford protective immunity while safely producing larger numbers of doses per unit of virus stock than current vaccines We report here the development of an ionizing radiation IR inactivated Sabin based vaccine using a reconstituted Mn decapeptide MDP antioxidant complex derived from the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans In bacteria Mn2 peptide antioxidants protect proteins from oxidative damage caused by extreme radiation exposure Here we show for the first time that MDP can protect immunogenic neutralizing epitopes in picornaviruses MDP protects epitopes in Polio Virus 1 and 2 Sabin strains PV1 S and PV2 S respectively but viral genomic RNA is not protected during supralethal irradiation IR inactivated Sabin viruses stimulated equivalent or improved neutralizing antibody responses in Wistar rats compared to the commercially used IPV products Our approach reduces the biosecurity risk of the current PV vaccine production method by utilizing the Sabin strains instead of the wild type neurovirulent strains Additionally the IR inactivation approach could provide a simpler faster and less costly process for producing a more immunogenic IPV Gamma irradiation is a well known method of virus inactivation and this vaccine approach could be adapted to any pathogen of interest

Enteroviruses which may cause neurological complications have become a public health threat worldwide in recent years Interactions between cellular proteins and enteroviral proteins could interfere with cellular biological processes to facilitate viral replication in infected cells Enteroviral RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRP known as 3D protein mainly functions as a replicase for viral RNA synthesis in infected cells However the 3D protein encoded by enterovirus A71 EV A71 could also interact with several cellular proteins to regulate cellular events and responses during infection To globally investigate the functions of the EV A71 3D protein in regulating biological processes in host cells we performed immunoprecipitation coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LC MS MS to identify host proteins that may associate with the 3D protein We found that the 3D protein interacts with factors involved in translation related biological processes including ribosomal proteins In addition polysome profiling analysis showed that the 3D protein cosediments with small and large subunits of ribosomes We further discovered that the EV A71 3D protein could enhance EV A71 internal ribosome entry site IRES dependent translation as well as cap dependent translation Collectively this research demonstrated that the RNA polymerase encoded by EV A71 could join a functional ribosomal complex and positively regulate viral and host translation

Almost a billion people worldwide are chronically undernourished Herein using a mouse model of coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 infection we report that a single day of food restriction FR markedly increases susceptibility to attenuated enterovirus infection replication and disease These pro viral effects which are rapidly reversed by the restoration of food are mediated by several genes whose expression is altered by FR and which support CVB3 replication Central to this is TFEB a protein whose expression and activation status are rapidly increased by FR TFEB which regulates the transcription of 100 genes involved in macroautophagy autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis responds similarly to both FR and CVB3 infection and plays a pivotal role in determining host susceptibility to CVB3 We propose that by upregulating TFEB FR generates an intracellular environment that is more hospitable to the incoming virus facilitating its replication This interplay between nutritional status and enterovirus replication has implications for human health and perhaps for the evolution of these viruses

Prompt initiation of empiric therapy is common practice in case of suspected meningitis or encephalitis However in children the most common pathogens are viruses that usually do not require and are not covered by the applied anti infective treatment Novel multiplex PCR mPCR panels provide rapid on site diagnostic testing for a variety of pathogens This study compared empiric antibiotic and acyclovir usage before and after the introduction of an on site FilmArray Meningitis Encephalitis Panel FA ME Panel

Acute flaccid myelitis AFM is a severe illness similar to paralytic poliomyelitis It is unclear how frequently AFM occurred in U S children after poliovirus elimination In 2014 an AFM cluster was identified in Colorado prompting passive US surveillance that yielded 120 AFM cases of unconfirmed etiology Subsequently increased reports were received in 2016 and 2018 To help inform investigations on causality of the recent AFM outbreaks our objective was to determine how frequently AFM had occurred before 2014 and if 2014 cases had different characteristics

Respiratory virome is an integral part of the human microbiome and its characterization may contribute to a better understanding of the changes that arise in the disease and consequently influence the approach and treatment of patients with acute lower respiratory infections The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation with and without acute lower respiratory infection respectively WRI and WORI groups

Our previous study of coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 induced unfolded protein responses UPR found that overexpression of ATF6a enhances CVB3 VP1 capsid protein production and increases viral particle formation These findings implicate that ATF6a signalling benefits CVB3 replication However the mechanism by which ATF6a signalling is transduced to promote virus replication is unclear In this study using a Tet On inducible ATF6a HeLa cell line we found that ATF6a signalling downregulated the protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum ER degradation enhancing α mannosidase like protein 1 EDEM1 resulting in accumulation of CVB3 VP1 protein in contrast expression of a dominant negative ATF6a had the opposite effect Furthermore we found that EDEM1 was cleaved by both CVB3 protease 3C and virus activated caspase and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway However overexpression of EDEM1 caused VP1 degradation likely via a glycosylation independent and ubiquitin lysosome pathway Finally we demonstrated that CRISPR Cas9 mediated knockout of EDEM1 increased VP1 accumulation and thus CVB3 replication This is the first study to report the ER protein quality control of non enveloped RNA virus and reveals a novel mechanism by which CVB3 evades host ER quality control pathways through cleavage and degradation of the UPR target gene EDEM1 to ultimately benefit its own replication

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is one of the most common intestinal virus that causes hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in infants and young children mostly 5 years of age Generally children with EV71 infected HFMD have mild symptoms that resolve spontaneously within 7 14 days without complications However some EV71 infected HFMD cases lead to severe complications such as aseptic meningitis encephalitis acute flaccid paralysis pulmonary edema cardiorespiratory complication circulatory disorders poliomyelitis like paralysis myocarditis meningoencephalitis neonatal sepsis and even death The mechanism of EV71 pathogenesis has been studied extensively and the regulation of host immune responses is suspected to aggravate EV71 induced severe complications Recently several cytokines or chemokines such as TNF

In recent years outbreaks of hand foot mouth disease HFMD in China Singapore and other Western Pacific Region involving millions of children have become a big threat to public health This study aimed to quantitatively assess all qualified studies and identify the risk factors for HFMD death A systematic search of the databases PubMed Medline Embase and the Cochrane Library was performed Study heterogeneity and publication bias were estimated Seven case control studies involving 1641 participants 634 died and 1007 survived were included in the meta analysis Human enterovirus 71 infection male age 3 years vomiting cyanosis convulsion duration of fever 3 days atypical rashes and abdominal distention were not significantly related to HFMD death P 0 05 Lethargy odds ratio OR 6 62 95 CI 3 61 12 14 I2 0 P 0 0001 pneumonoedema pneumorrhagia OR 4 09 95 CI 2 44 6 87 I2 0 P 0 0001 seizures OR 6 85 95 CI 2 37 19 74 I2 0 P 0 0004 dyspnoea OR 8 24 95 CI 2 05 33 19 I2 83 P 0 003 and coma OR 3 76 95 CI 1 85 7 67 I2 0 P 0 0003 were significantly associated with HFMD death which were risk factors for HFMD death

Flaviviruses including dengue virus DENV and Zika virus ZIKV rely heavily on the availability of endoplasmic reticulum ER membranes throughout their life cycle and degradation of ER membranes restricts flavivirus replication Accordingly DENV and ZIKV restrict ER turnover by protease mediated cleavage of reticulophagy regulator 1 RETREG1 also known as FAM134B an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation Given that the induction of autophagy may play an important role in flavivirus replication the antiviral role of RETREG1 suggests that specialized autophagic pathways may have differential effects on the flavivirus life cycle We previously identified BPI fold containing family B member 3 BPIFB3 as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication Here we show that in contrast to enteroviruses BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNA interference mediated silencing inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles Mechanistically we show that depletion of BPIFB3 enhances RETREG1 dependent reticulophagy leading to enhanced ER turnover and the suppression of viral replication Consistent with this the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion can be reversed by RETREG1 silencing suggesting a specific role for BPIFB3 in regulating ER turnover These studies define BPIFB3 as a required host factor for both DENV and ZIKV replication and further contribute to our understanding of the requirements for autophagy during flavivirus infection

Human rhinoviruses HRVs are the predominant infectious agents for the common cold worldwide The HRV C species cause severe illnesses in children and are closely related to acute exacerbations of asthma 3C protease a highly conserved enzyme cleaves the viral polyprotein during replication and assists the virus in escaping the host immune system These key roles make 3C protease an important drug target A few structures of 3Cs complexed with an irreversible inhibitor rupintrivir have been determined These structures shed light on the determinants of drug specificity Here we describe the structures of HRV C15 3C in free and inhibitor bound forms The volume decreased S1 subsite and half closed S2 subsite which were thought to be unique features of enterovirus A 3C proteases appear in the HRV C 3C protease Rupintrivir assumes an intermediate conformation in the complex which might open up additional avenues for the design of potent antiviral inhibitors Analysis of the features of the three dimensional structures and the amino acid sequences of 3C proteases suggest new applications for existing drugs

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a febrile exanthematous disease with typical or atypical symptoms Typical HFMD is usually caused by enterovirus 71 EV71 or coxsackievirus A16 while atypical HFMD is usually caused by coxsackievirus A6 CA6 In recent years worldwide outbreaks of CA6 associated HFMD have dramatically increased although the pathogenic mechanism of CA6 is still unclear EV71 has been established to induce caspase dependent apoptosis but in this study we demonstrate that CA6 infection promotes a distinct pathway of cell death that involves loss of cell membrane integrity Necrostatin 1 an inhibitor of necroptosis blocks the cell death induced by CA6 infection but Z DEVD FMK an inhibitor of caspase 3 has no effect on CA6 induced cell death Furthermore CA6 infection up regulates the expression of the necroptosis signaling molecule RIPK3 Importantly necrostatin 1 inhibits CA6 viral production as assessed by its ability to inhibit levels of VP1 protein and genomic RNA and infectious particles CA6 induced necroptosis is not dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species however viral 3D protein can directly bind RIPK3 which is suggestive of a direct mechanism of necroptosis induction Therefore these results indicate that CA6 induces a mechanism of RIPK3 dependent necroptosis for viral production that is distinct from the mechanism of apoptosis induced by typical HFMD viruses

Previous studies have found evidence of viral interference between seasonal respiratory viruses Using laboratory confirmed data from a Utah based healthcare provider Intermountain Health Care we analyzed the time specific patterns of respiratory syncytial virus RSV influenza A influenza B human metapneumovirus rhinovirus and enterovirus circulation from 2004 to 2018 using descriptive methods and wavelet analysis

Infection by

Enterovirus 71 EV A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 CV A16 are the two most common pathogens causing hand foot and mouth disease HFMD Previously we obtained one candidate live attenuated strain each for EV A71 and CV A16 here we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a combinedlive vaccine against EV A71 and CV A16 generated from these two candidate strains Rhesus monkeys were intramuscularly treated with a live combinationvaccine against both EV A71 and CV A16 or with either vaccine alone No fever or atypical clinical signs were observed in any animals Monkeys vaccinated with the combinationlive vaccine presented no notable pathological changes in the brain spinal cord lung and liver in contrast these regions showed inflammatory cell infiltration in monkeys treated with EV A71 alone or CV A16 alone Weak viremia was detected in plasma after inoculation with the combinationvaccine however the duration of viral shedding in feces was increased Biochemical studies revealed a slight increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels in monkeys inoculated with the live combination vaccine however histopathological findings did not attribute this change to liver damage We also found that the live combinationvaccine induced a dual humoral immune response Cytokine analysis indicated that the combined EV A71 CV A16 vaccine significantly down regulated interleukin 8 production Here we have demonstrated that the live attenuated EV A71 CV A16 vaccine was safe and could trigger a dual specific immune response However its immune protection efficacy requires further investigation

Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 a member of

Although there have been no cases of serotype 2 wild poliovirus for more than 20 years transmission of serotype 2 vaccine derived poliovirus VDPV2 and associated paralytic cases in several continents represent a threat to eradication The withdrawal of the serotype 2 component of oral poliovirus vaccine OPV2 was implemented in April 2016 to stop VDPV2 emergence and secure eradication of all serotype 2 poliovirus Globally children born after this date have limited immunity to prevent transmission Using a statistical model we estimated the emergence date and source of VDPV2s detected between May 2016 and November 2019 Outbreak response campaigns with monovalent OPV2 are the only available method to induce immunity to prevent transmission Yet our analysis shows that using monovalent OPV2 is generating more paralytic VDPV2 outbreaks with the potential for establishing endemic transmission A novel OPV2 for which two candidates are currently in clinical trials is urgently required together with a contingency strategy if this vaccine does not materialize or perform as anticipated

Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 is the most common cause of acute and chronic viral myocarditis primarily in children while human adenovirus infections represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in people of all ages A series of novel 2 benzoxyl phenylpyridine derivatives were evaluated for their potential antiviral activities against CVB3 and adenovirus type 7 ADV7 Preliminary assays indicated that some of these compounds exhibited excellent antiviral effects on both CVB3 and ADV7 viruses they could effectively inhibit virus induced cytopathic effects reduce viral progeny yields and had similar or superior antiviral activities compared with the control drug ribavirin Further these compounds targeted the early stages of CVB3 replication in cells including viral RNA replication and protein synthesis rather than inactivating the virus directly inhibiting virus adsorption entry or affecting viral release from cells Our data demonstrate that the tested 2 benzoxyl phenylpyridine derivatives are effective inhibitors of CVB3 and ADV7 raising the possibility that these compounds might be feasible candidates for anti viral agents

Enteroviruses are common agents of infectious disease that are spread by the fecal oral route They are readily inactivated by mild heat which causes the viral capsid to disintegrate or undergo conformational change While beneficial for the thermal treatment of food or water this heat sensitivity poses challenges for the stability of enterovirus vaccines The thermostability of an enterovirus can be modulated by the composition of the suspending matrix though the effects of the matrix on virus stability are not understood Here we determined the thermostability of four enterovirus strains in solutions with various concentrations of NaCl and different pH values The experimental findings were combined with molecular modeling of the protein interaction forces at the pentamer and the protomer interfaces of the viral capsids While pH only had a modest effect on thermostability increasing NaCl concentrations raised the breakpoint temperatures of all viruses tested by up to 20 C This breakpoint shift could be explained by an enhancement of the van der Waals attraction forces at the two protein interfaces In comparison the net repulsive electrostatic interactions were less affected by NaCl Depending on the interface considered the breakpoint temperature shifted by 7 5 or 5 6 C per 100 kcal mol Å increase in protein interaction force

Assessment of possible infection with SARS CoV 2 the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID 19 illness has been a major activity of infection services since the first reports of cases in December 2019

Coxsackievirus B CVB is a common human enterovirus that causes systemic infection but specifically replicates to high titers in the pancreas It was reported that certain viruses induce mitochondrial fission to support infection We documented that CVB triggers mitochondrial fission and blocking mitochondrial fission limits infection The transient receptor potential channels have been implicated in regulating mitochondrial dynamics namely the heat and capsaicin receptor transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 TRPV1 contributes to mitochondrial depolarization and fission When we transiently warmed HeLa cells to 39 C prior to CVB exposure infection was heightened whereas cooling cells to 25 C reduced infection Inducing cold by stimulating transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 TRPM8 with menthol led to reduced infection and also resulted in lower levels of mitochondrial fission during infection Additionally menthol stabilized levels of mitochondrial antiviral signaling MAVS which is known to be tied to mitochondrial dynamics Taken together this highlights a novel pathway wherein CVB relies on TRPV1 to initiate proviral mitochondrial fission which may contribute to the disruption of antiviral immunity TRPM8 has been shown to antagonize TRPV1 and thus we hypothesize that stimulating TRPM8 blocks TRPV1 mediated mitochondrial fragmentation following CVB exposure and attenuates infection

Coxsackievirus group B CVB contains six serotypes that can affect various organs Some of these organ specific diseases such as myocarditis and pancreatitis can be caused by more than one serotype Thus development of immunological tools common to multiple serotypes is desired This is especially critical for analyzing antigen specific T cell responses at a single cell level To this end we made efforts to identify the immunogenic epitopes of CVB3 leading us to localize three T cell epitopes within the viral protein 1 VP1 namely VP1 681 700 VP1 721 740 and VP1 771 790 First we confirmed their immunogenicity in the immunization settings Second we sought to verify the ability of VP1 epitopes to bind major histocompatibility complex MHC class II IA

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 has been noted for its tendency to lead to neurological manifestations in young children and infants Although the alimentary tract has been identified as the primary replication site of this virus how EV A71 replicates in the gut and is transmitted to other organs remains unclear

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD remains a threat to the Asia Pacific region The epidemiological characteristics and pathogen spectrum of HFMD vary with space and time These variations are crucial for HFMD interventions but poorly understood in Sichuan Province China particularly after the introduction of the EV A71 vaccine Using descriptive methods regression analyses spatial autocorrelation analysis and space time scan statistics we analysed the epidemiological and aetiological characteristics of HFMD surveillance data in Sichuan Province between 2011 and 2017 to identify spatio temporal variations The dominant serotypes of HFMD have changed from enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 to other enteroviruses since 2013 The seasonal pattern of HFMD showed two peaks generally occurring from April to July and November to December however the seasonal pattern varied by prefecture and enterovirus serotype From 2011 to 2017 spatio temporal clusters were increasingly concentrated in Chengdu with several small clusters in northeast Sichuan The clusters observed in southern Sichuan from 2011 to 2015 disappeared in 2016 2017 These findings highlight the importance of pathogen surveillance and vaccination strategies for HFMD interventions future prevention and control of HFMD should focus on Chengdu and its vicinity

Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis Among these viruses La Crosse virus LACV a member of the California serogroup circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States While LACV infection is often asymptomatic dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly Unfortunately no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection Here we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection From this screen we identified several potential antiviral molecules including known antivirals Additionally we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability Valinomycin a potassium ionophore was among our top targets We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose dependent manner Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions a known determinant of LACV entry We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses Rift Valley fever virus Keystone virus enteroviruses coxsackievirus rhinovirus flavirivuses Zika virus and coronaviruses human coronavirus 229E HCoV 229E and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV MERS CoV In all viral infections we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin treated cells In sum we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication

RNA virus survival depends on efficient viral genome replication which is performed by the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp The recent development of high throughput magnetic tweezers has enabled the simultaneous observation of dozens of viral RdRp elongation traces on kilobases long templates and this has shown that RdRp nucleotide addition kinetics is stochastically interrupted by rare pauses of 1 1000 s duration of which the short lived ones 1 10 s are the temporal signature of a low fidelity catalytic pathway We present a simple and precise temperature controlled system for magnetic tweezers to characterize the replication kinetics temperature dependence between 25 C and 45 C of RdRps from three RNA viruses i e the double stranded RNA bacteriophage Φ6 and the positive sense single stranded RNA poliovirus PV and human rhinovirus C HRV C We found that Φ6 RdRp is largely temperature insensitive while PV and HRV C RdRps replication kinetics are activated by temperature Furthermore the activation energies we measured for PV RdRp catalytic state corroborate previous estimations from ensemble pre steady state kinetic studies further confirming the catalytic origin of the short pauses and their link to temperature independent RdRp fidelity This work will enable future temperature controlled study of biomolecular complex at the single molecule level

Valosin containing protein VCP plays roles in various cellular activities Recently Enterovirus A71 EVA71 infection was found to hijack the VCP protein However the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear Using chemical inhibitor RNA interference and dominant negative mutant we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection 31 known VCP cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments The results showed that UFD1 ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1 but not NPL4 NPL4 homolog ubiquitin recognition factor played critical roles in infections by EVA71 UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus causing single round infection while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays In addition knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes Mechanistically we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein a coreceptor of EVA71 Together these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71

Echovirus 30 E30 a member of the enterovirus B species is a major cause of viral meningitis targeting children and adults alike While it is a frequently isolated enterovirus and the cause of several outbreaks all over the world surprisingly little is known regarding its entry and replication strategy within cells In this study we used E30 strain Bastianni E30B generated from an infectious cDNA clone in order to study early entry events during infection in human RD cells E30B required the newly discovered Fc echovirus receptor FcRn for successful infection but not the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor CAR or decay accelerating factor DAF although an interaction with DAF was observed Double stranded RNA replication intermediate was generated between 2 and 3 h postinfection p i and viral capsid production was initiated between 4 and 5 h p i The drugs affecting Rac1 NSC 23766 and cholesterol filipin III compromised infection whereas bafilomycin A1 dyngo U 73122 wortmannin and nocodazole did not suggesting the virus follows an enterovirus triggered macropinocytic pathway rather than the clathrin pathway Colocalization with early endosomes and increased infection due to constitutively active Rab5 expression suggests some overlap and entry to classical early endosomes Taken together these results suggest that E30B induces an enterovirus entry pathway leading to uncoating in early endosomes

Malignant gliomas the most lethal type of primary brain tumor continue to be a major therapeutic challenge Here we found that enterovirus A71 EV A71 can be developed as a novel oncolytic agent against malignant gliomas EV A71 preferentially infected and killed malignant glioma cells relative to normal glial cells The virus receptor human scavenger receptor class B member 2 SCARB2 and phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate induced protein 1 PMAIP1 mediated cell death were involved in EV A71 induced oncolysis In mice with implanted subcutaneous gliomas intraneoplastic inoculation of EV A71 caused significant tumor growth inhibition Furthermore in mice bearing intracranial orthotopic gliomas intraneoplastic inoculation of EV A71 substantially prolonged survival By insertion of brain specific microRNA 124 miR124 response elements into the viral genome we improved the tumor specificity of EV A71 oncolytic therapy by reducing its neurotoxicity while maintaining its replication potential and oncolytic capacity in gliomas Our study reveals that EV A71 is a potent oncolytic agent against malignant gliomas and may have a role in treating this tumor in the clinical setting

Prophylactic vaccines are critical in preventing hand foot and mouth disease HFMD primarily caused by human enterovirus 71 EV71 infection Children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to EV71 infections In addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus those containing virus like particles VLPs with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for EV71 infections with safety and productivity advantages We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein which assembled into spherical particles This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection

The live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine OPV or Sabin vaccine replicates in gut associated tissues eliciting mucosa and systemic immunity OPV protects from disease and limits poliovirus spread Accordingly vaccination with OPV is the primary strategy used to end the circulation of all polioviruses However the ability of OPV to regain replication fitness and establish new epidemics represents a significant risk of polio re emergence should immunization cease Here we report the development of a poliovirus type 2 vaccine strain nOPV2 that is genetically more stable and less likely to regain virulence than the original Sabin2 strain We introduced modifications within at the 5 untranslated region of the Sabin2 genome to stabilize attenuation determinants 2C coding region to prevent recombination and 3D polymerase to limit viral adaptability Prior work established that nOPV2 is immunogenic in preclinical and clinical studies and thus may enable complete poliovirus eradication

End stage renal disease ESRD is described by four primary diagnoses diabetes hypertension glomerulonephritis and cystic kidney disease all of which have viruses implicated as causative agents Enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus CV are a common genus of viruses that have been implicated in both diabetes and cystic kidney disease however little is known about how CVs cause kidney injury and ESRD or predispose individuals with a genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes T1D to kidney injury This study evaluated kidney injury resulting from coxsackievirus B4 CVB4 inoculation of non obese diabetic NOD mice to glean a better understanding of how viral exposure may predispose individuals with a genetic susceptibility to T1D to kidney injury The objectives were to assess acute and chronic kidney damage in CVB4 inoculated NOD mice without diabetes Results indicated the presence of CVB4 RNA in the kidney for at least 14 days post CVB4 inoculation and a coordinated pattern recognition receptor response but the absence of an immune response or cytotoxicity CVB4 inoculated NOD mice also had a higher propensity to develop an increase in mesangial area 17 weeks post CVB4 inoculation These studies identified initial gene expression changes in the kidney resulting from CVB4 exposure that may predispose to ESRD Thus this study provides an initial characterization of kidney injury resulting from CVB4 inoculation of mice that are genetically susceptible to developing T1D that may one day provide better therapeutic options and predictive measures for patients who are at risk for developing kidney disease from T1D

Microbial source tracking and a mass balance approach were used to identify sources of fecal indicator bacteria FIB in the Hanalei River Kaua i Hawai i Historically concentrations enterococci and Clostridium perfringens were significantly higher during storm flows compared to non storm flows in the Hanalei River and correlated to total suspended solids in the river During targeted dry weather studies the Hanalei River bed sediments and streambank soils were documented to harbor E coli enterococci and the human and pig specific fecal markers in Bacteroidales suggesting that sediments and soils may be potential sources of these microorganisms to the Hanalei river The human specific marker in Bacteroidales was four times as likely to be detected in sediment and soil samples as in water samples Furthermore the occurrence of host specific source tracking markers is indicative that a portion of FIB present in the Hanalei River are of fecal origin A mass balance approach was used to explore causes of observed FIB loadings and losses along different reaches of the river Resuspension or deposition of FIB laden river sediments cannot account for changes in E coli and enterococci concentrations along the river during dry weather Additionally losses due to bacterial inactivation were insignificant Groundwater and ditches draining agricultural and urban lands were shown to provide sufficient FIB fluxes to account for the observed loads along some river reaches The presence of the human specific Bacteroidales marker in the river water sediments and adjacent soils as well as the presence of the human enterovirus marker in the water suggests that there is widespread human fecal contamination in the Hanalei River that is likely a result of nearby wastewater disposal systems

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 a positive stranded RNA virus of the Picornaviridae family may cause neurological complications or fatality in children We examined specific factors responsible for this virulence using a chemical genetics approach Known compounds from an anti EV A71 herbal medicine

The Enterovirus 71 EV71 VP4 is co translationally linked to myristic acid at its amino terminal glycine residue However the role of this myristoylation in the EV71 life cycle remains largely unknown To investigate this issue we developed a myristoylation deficient virus and reporter luciferase pseudovirus with a Gly to Ala mutation G2A on EV71 VP4 When transfecting the EV71 G2A genome encoding plasmid in cells the loss of myristoylation on VP4 did not affect the expression of viral proteins and the virus morphology however it did significantly influence viral infectivity Further in myristoylation deficient reporter pseudovirus infected cells the luciferase activity and viral genome RNA decreased significantly as compared to that of wild type virus however cytopathic effect and viral capsid proteins were not detected in myristoylation deficient virus infected cells Also although myristoylation deficient viral RNA and proteins were detected in the second blind passage of infection they were much fewer in number compared to that of the wild type virus The replication of genomic RNA and negative strand viral RNA were both blocked in myristoylation deficient viruses suggesting that myristoylation affects viral genome RNA release from capsid to cytoplasm Besides loss of myristoylation on VP4 altered the distribution of VP4 green fluorescent protein protein which disappeared from the membrane structure fraction Finally a liposome leakage assay showed that EV71 myristoylation mediates the permeability of the model membrane Hence the amino terminal myristoylation of VP4 is pivotal to EV71 infection and capsid membrane structure interaction This study provides novel molecular mechanisms regarding EV71 infection and potential molecular targets for antiviral drug design

Acute gastroenteritis AGE is a common illness in both adults and children worldwide and is caused by several microorganisms including viruses bacteria and parasites Rotavirus RV which is the main cause of AGE can occur as a mixed infection with other viruses The aim of this study is to assess the molecular epidemiology of viral enteric viruses and assess RV coinfections with other enteric viruses and their influence on disease severity before and after RV vaccine introduction in children under 5 years of age A total of 600 samples collected from children hospitalized for AGE in five large hospitals in Norway and were analyzed for viral gastroenteritis agents by enzyme immunoassay and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qRT PCR Positive results confirmed either by Sanger sequencing or genotyped by multiplex semi nested RT PCR In total 243 of the 300 81 samples collected from the prevaccine cohort were positive for at least one of the four viruses tested in this study RV was most frequently identified in 82 6 of the samples In the postvaccine cohort 114 of the 300 38 samples were positive for at least one of the viruses tested RV found in 36 5 of the samples Coinfections found less frequently in the postvaccine cohort Among circulating enteric viruses in Norway RV is the most important cause of viral gastrointestinal infection As expected there were fewer RV positive and fewer coinfections after RV vaccine implementation The results provide valuable data that can aid in further evaluation of the vaccine impact

In April 2019 a suspect cluster of enterovirus cases was reported in a neonatology department in Guangdong China resulting in five deaths We aimed to investigate the pathogen profiles in fatal cases the circulation and transmission pattern of the viruses by combining metatranscriptomic phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses Metatranscriptomic sequencing was used to characterize the enteroviruses Clinical and environmental surveillance in the local population was performed to understand the prevalence and genetic diversity of the viruses in the local population The possible source s evolution transmission and recombination of the viruses were investigated by incorporating genomes from the current outbreak from local retrospective surveillance and from public databases Metatranscriptomic analysis identified Echovirus 11 E11 in three fatal cases Seroprevalence of neutralization antibody to E11 was 35 to 44 per cent in 3 15 age groups of general population and the viruses were associated with various clinical symptoms From the viral phylogeny nosocomial transmissions were identified and all E11 2019 outbreak strains were closely related with E11 strains circulating in local population 2017 19 Frequent recombination occurred among the 2019 Guangdong E11 outbreak strains and various genotypes in enterovirus B species This study provides an example of combining advanced genetic technology and epidemiological surveillance in pathogen diagnosis source s and transmission tracing during an infectious disease outbreak The result highlights the hidden E11 circulation and the risk of viral transmission and infection in the young age population in China Frequent recombination between Guangdong like strains and other enterovirus genotypes also implies the prevalence of these emerging E11 strains

Enterovirus 71 EV71 infection causes hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and even fatal neurological complications However the mechanisms underlying EV71 neurological pathogeneses are largely unknown This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which EV71 induces apoptosis and autophagy in neural cells EV71 non structure protein 3D also known as RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp interacts with the peroxisomal protein acyl CoA oxidase 1 ACOX1 and contributes to ACOX1 downregulation Further studies demonstrate that EV71 reduces peroxisome numbers Additionally knockdown of ACOX1 or peroxin 19 PEX19 induces apoptosis and autophagy in neural cells including human neuroblastoma SK N SH cells and human astrocytoma U251 cells and EV71 infection induces neural cell death through attenuating ACOX1 production Moreover EV71 infection and ACOX1 knockdown facilitate reactive oxygen species ROS production and attenuate the

Coxsackieviruses primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans but they can disseminate systemically and cause severe disease Using antibiotic treatment regimens to deplete intestinal microbes in mice several groups have shown that bacteria promote oral infection with a variety of enteric viruses However it is unknown whether antibiotics have microbiota independent antiviral effects for enteric viruses or whether antibiotics influence extra intestinal systemic infection Here we examined the effects of antibiotics on systemic enteric virus infection by performing intraperitoneal injections of either coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 or poliovirus followed by quantification of viral titers We found that antibiotic treatment reduced systemic infection for both viruses Interestingly antibiotics reduced CVB3 titers in germ free mice suggesting that antibiotic treatment alters CVB3 infection through a microbiota independent mechanism Overall these data provide further evidence that antibiotics can have noncanonical effects on viral infection

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 infection may cause severe respiratory system manifestations in pediatric populations Because of the lack of an effective preventive vaccine or specific therapeutic drug for this infection the development of EV D68 specific vaccines and antibodies has become increasingly important In this study we prepared an experimental EV D68 vaccine inactivated by formaldehyde and found that the serum of rhesus macaques immunized with the inactivated EV D68 vaccine exhibited potent neutralizing activity against EV D68 virus in vitro Subsequently the antibody mediated immune response of B cells elicited by the inactivated vaccine was evaluated in a rhesus monkey model The binding activity in vitro neutralization activity and sequence properties of 28 paired antibodies from the rhesus macaques EV D68 specific single memory B cells were analyzed and the EV D68 VP1 specific antibody group was found to be the main constituent in vivo Intriguingly we also found a synergistic effect among the E15 E18 and E20 monoclonal antibodies from the rhesus macaques Furthermore we demonstrated the protective efficacy of maternal antibodies in suckling C57BL 6 mice This study provides valuable information for the future development of EV D68 vaccines

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 EV71 can lead to high morbidity and mortality and genetic background plays an important role during the disease process We investigated the association between the single nucleotide polymorphism SNP rs2564978 of the CD55 gene and susceptibility to and severity of HFMD using the SNPs can multiple SNP typing methods Soluble CD55 sCD55 expression was significantly lower in the EV71 HFMD group than in the control group and lower in severe cases than in mild cases P 001 Moreover CD55 rs2564978 C vs T OR 1 300 95 CI 1 120 1 509 was associated with the risk of EV71 infection and genotype TC was related to the severity of the infection TC vs TT OR 4 523 95 CI 2 033 10 066 Our results suggest that sCD55 expression and the CD55 polymorphism rs2564978 may influence the susceptibility to and severity of EV71 infection

Co infection has been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome but there is limited knowledge on co infection among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 The prevalence of co infection was variable among COVID 19 patients in different studies however it could be up to 50 among non survivors Co pathogens included bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus Klebsiella pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumonia Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii Candida species and Aspergillus flavus and viruses such as influenza coronavirus rhinovirus enterovirus parainfluenza metapneumovirus influenza B virus and human immunodeficiency virus Influenza A was one of the most common co infective viruses which may have caused initial false negative results of real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co infection from SARS CoV 2 infection Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS CoV 2 may facilitate the early detection of co infection among COVID 19 patients By contrast clinicians cannot rule out SARS CoV 2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID 19 pandemic Therefore clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID 19 patients Clinicians can neither rule out other co infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS CoV 2 infection nor rule out COVID 19 by detection of non SARS CoV 2 respiratory pathogens After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co infection among COVID 19 patients appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 infection has been associated with outbreaks of severe respiratory illness and increased cases of nonpolio acute flaccid myelitis The patterns of EV D68 circulation and molecular epidemiology are not fully understood In this study nasopharyngeal NP specimens collected from patients in the Lower Hudson Valley New York from 2014 to 2018 were examined for rhinovirus enterovirus RhV EV by the FilmArray respiratory panel Selected RhV EV positive NP specimens were analyzed using two EV D68 specific real time RT PCR assays Sanger sequencing and metatranscriptomic next generation sequencing A total of 2 398 NP specimens were examined EV D68 was detected in 348 patients with NP specimens collected in 2014

Coxsackievirus B CVB enteroviruses are common human pathogens known to cause severe diseases including myocarditis chronic dilated cardiomyopathy and aseptic meningitis CVBs are also hypothesized to be a causal factor in type 1 diabetes Vaccines against CVBs are not currently available and here we describe the generation and preclinical testing of a novel hexavalent vaccine targeting the six known CVB serotypes We show that the vaccine has an excellent safety profile in murine models and nonhuman primates and that it induces strong neutralizing antibody responses to the six serotypes in both species without an adjuvant We also demonstrate that the vaccine provides immunity against acute CVB infections in mice including CVB infections known to cause virus induced myocarditis In addition it blocks CVB induced diabetes in a genetically permissive mouse model Our preclinical proof of concept studies demonstrate the successful generation of a promising hexavalent CVB vaccine with high immunogenicity capable of preventing CVB induced diseases

In July December 2018 an outbreak of polio like acute flaccid myelitis AFM occurred in Zhejiang province China Enterovirus EV D68 infection has been reported to be associated with AFM This study aimed to investigate the clinical presentation laboratory findings and outcomes of AFM patients We investigated the clinical and virologic information regarding the AFM patients and real time PCR sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to investigate the cause of AFM Eighteen cases met the definition of AFM with a median age of 4 05 years range 0 9 9 years and nine 50 were EV D68 positive Symptoms included acute flaccid limb weakness and cranial nerve dysfunction On magnetic resonance imaging 11 61 1 patients had spinal gray matter abnormalities Electromyography results of 16 out of 17 patients 94 1 were abnormal Cerebrospinal fluid CSF pleocytosis was common 94 4 while CSF protein concentration was normal in all patients There was little improvement after early aggressive therapy Phylogenetic analysis revealed that EV D68 subclade B3 was the predominant lineage circulating in Zhejiang province in 2018

Palatine tonsils have been observed to harbor several distinct respiratory and herpesviruses in separate studies In this study the presence of these viruses in palatine tonsils was comprehensively studied in both children and adults A cross sectional analysis of 181 patients median age 22 years range 2 6 66 operated for a benign tonsillar disease was conducted Real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect 27 distinct viruses in all eight human herpesviruses 16 respiratory viruses parvo B19 and polyoma BK JC viruses Clinical characteristics of the patients and underlying conditions were evaluated In total 92 of patients had virus detected in tonsils Epstein Barr virus 72 human herpesvirus 7 and 6B 54 and 16 respectively enterovirus 18 parvovirus B19 7 and the rest 4 No herpes simplex virus 2 varicella zoster virus polyoma JC virus parainfluenza metapneumo or coronaviruses were found Enterovirus was more common in children and was frequently observed in the presence of HHV6B None of the viruses showed a positive association to the tonsillar disease Respiratory symptoms were not associated with the prevalence of viruses This study comprehensively reports a cross sectional view of intratonsillar virus infections in elective tonsillectomy patients in a wide age range cohort Tonsils are a major virus reservoir for distinct herpes and respiratory viruses without a positive association with tonsillar disease or respiratory symptoms

Immunological assays detecting antibodies against enteroviruses typically use a single enterovirus serotype as antigen This limits the ability of such assays to detect antibodies against different enterovirus types and to detect possible type specific variation in antibody responses We set out to develop a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection of antibodies against multiple enterovirus and rhinovirus types encompassing all human infecting species Seven recombinant VP1 proteins from enteroviruses EV A to EV D and rhinoviruses RV A to RV C species were produced Using Meso Scale Diagnostics U PLEX platform we were able to study antibody reactions against these proteins as well as non structural enterovirus proteins in a single well with 140 human serum samples Adults had on average 33 fold stronger antibody responses to these antigens

Global poliovirus surveillance involves virus isolation from stool and environmental samples intratypic differential ITD by PCR and sequencing of the VP1 region to distinguish vaccine Sabin vaccine derived and wild type polioviruses and to ensure an appropriate response This cell culture algorithm takes 2 to 3 weeks on average between sample receipt and sequencing Direct detection of viral RNA using PCR allows faster detection but has traditionally faced challenges related to poor sensitivity and difficulties in sequencing common samples containing poliovirus and enterovirus mixtures We present a nested PCR and nanopore sequencing protocol that allows rapid 3 days and sensitive direct detection and sequencing of polioviruses in stool and environmental samples We developed barcoded primers and a real time analysis platform that generate accurate VP1 consensus sequences from multiplexed samples The sensitivity and specificity of our protocol compared with those of cell culture were 90 9 95 confidence interval 75 7 to 98 1 and 99 2 95 5 to 100 0 for wild type 1 poliovirus 92 5 79 6 to 98 4 and 98 7 95 4 to 99 8 for vaccine and vaccine derived serotype 2 poliovirus and 88 3 81 2 to 93 5 and 93 2 88 6 to 96 3 for Sabin 1 and 3 poliovirus alone or in mixtures when tested on 155 stool samples in Pakistan Variant analysis of sequencing reads also allowed the identification of polioviruses and enteroviruses in artificial mixtures and was able to distinguish complex mixtures of polioviruses in environmental samples The median identity of consensus nanopore sequences with Sanger or Illumina sequences from the same samples was 99 9 This novel method shows promise as a faster and safer alternative to cell culture for the detection and real time sequencing of polioviruses in stool and environmental samples

This study assessed wastewater quality through the quantification of four human enteric viruses and the applicability of pepper mild mottle virus PMMoV and tobacco mosaic virus TMV as indicators of viral reduction during wastewater treatment Thirty three samples were collected from three steps of a wastewater treatment plant in Southern Louisiana USA for a year between March 2017 and February 2018 Noroviruses of genogroup I were the most prevalent human enteric viruses in influent samples The concentrations of PMMoV in influent samples 5 9 0 7 log

After the globally coordinated cessation of any serotype of oral poliovirus vaccine OPV some risks remain from undetected existing homotypic OPV related transmission and or restarting transmission due to several possible reintroduction risks The Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI coordinated global cessation of serotype 2 containing OPV OPV2 in 2016 Following OPV2 cessation the GPEI and countries implemented activities to withdraw all the remaining trivalent OPV which contains all three poliovirus serotypes i e 1 2 and 3 from the supply chain and replace it with bivalent OPV containing only serotypes 1 and 3 However as of early 2020 monovalent OPV2 use for outbreak response continues in many countries In addition outbreaks observed in 2019 demonstrated evidence of different types of risks than previously modeled We briefly review the 2019 epidemiological experience with serotype 2 live poliovirus outbreaks and propose a new risk for unexpected OPV introduction for inclusion in global modeling of OPV cessation Using an updated model of global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution with and without consideration of this new risk we explore the implications of the current global situation with respect to the likely need to restart preventive use of OPV2 in OPV using countries Simulation results without this new risk suggest OPV2 restart will likely need to occur 81 of 100 iterations to manage the polio endgame based on the GPEI performance to date with existing vaccine tools and with the new risk of unexpected OPV introduction the expected OPV2 restart probability increases to 89 Contingency planning requires new OPV2 bulk production including genetically stabilized OPV2 strains

Enterovirus EV infection of insulin producing pancreatic beta cells is associated with type 1 diabetes T1D but little is known about the mechanisms that lead the virus to cause a persistent infection and possibly to induce beta cell autoimmunity A cell line susceptible to most enterovirus types was infected with EV isolates from cases of T1D and for comparison with a replication competent strain of coxsackievirus B3 The transcription of immune related genes and secretion of cytokines was evaluated in infected vs uninfected cells Acutely infected cells showed the preserved transcription of type I interferon IFN pathways and the enhanced transcription secretion of

Coxsackie B viruses CVB cause a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from mild respiratory syndromes and hand foot and mouth disease to life threatening conditions such as pancreatitis myocarditis and encephalitis Previously we and others found that the soluble virus receptor trap sCAR Fc strongly attenuates CVB3 infection in mice In this study we investigated whether treatment with sCAR Fc results in development of resistance by CVB3 Two CVB3 strains CVB3 H3 and CVB3 Nancy were passaged in HeLa cells in the presence of sCAR Fc The CVB3 H3 strain did not develop resistance whereas two populations of CVB3 Nancy mutants emerged one with complete CVB3

EV A120 is a recently identified serotype of the enterovirus A species Only one full length genomic sequence is currently available in GenBank and very few studies have been conducted on EV A120 globally Thus additional information and research on EV A120 are needed to explore its genetic characteristics phylogeny and relationship with enteroviral disease In this study we report the phylogenetic characteristics of a EV A120 strain

Antimicrobial resistant and novel pathogens continue to emerge outpacing efforts to contain and treat them Therefore there is a crucial need for safe and effective therapies Ultraviolet A UVA phototherapy is FDA approved for several dermatological diseases but not for internal applications We investigated UVA effects on human cells in vitro mouse colonic tissue in vivo and UVA efficacy against bacteria yeast coxsackievirus group B and coronavirus 229E Several pathogens and virally transfected human cells were exposed to a series of specific UVA exposure regimens HeLa alveolar and primary human tracheal epithelial cell viability was assessed after UVA exposure and 8 Oxo 2 deoxyguanosine was measured as an oxidative DNA damage marker Furthermore wild type mice were exposed to intracolonic UVA as an in vivo model to assess safety of internal UVA exposure Controlled UVA exposure yielded significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Klebsiella pneumoniae Escherichia coli Enterococcus faecalis Clostridioides difficile Streptococcus pyogenes Staphylococcus epidermidis Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans UVA treated coxsackievirus transfected HeLa cells exhibited significantly increased cell survival compared to controls UVA treated coronavirus 229E transfected tracheal cells exhibited significant coronavirus spike protein reduction increased mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and decreased coronavirus 229E induced cell death Specific controlled UVA exposure had no significant effect on growth or 8 Oxo 2 deoxyguanosine levels in three types of human cells Single or repeated in vivo intraluminal UVA exposure produced no discernible endoscopic histologic or dysplastic changes in mice These findings suggest that under specific conditions UVA reduces various pathogens including coronavirus 229E and may provide a safe and effective treatment for infectious diseases of internal viscera Clinical studies are warranted to further elucidate the safety and efficacy of UVA in humans

Human enteroviral infections are suggested to be associated with type 1 diabetes However the mechanism by which enteroviruses can trigger disease remains unknown The present study aims to investigate the impact of enterovirus on autophagy a cellular process that regulates beta cell homeostasis using the clonal beta cell line INS 832 13 and human islet cells as in vitro models

Enteroviruses EVs can cause infections and outbreaks of mild to severe diseases such as central nervous system CNS and systemic infections The contribution of EVs to acute CNS systemic infections requiring hospitalization was assessed by analysing data extracted from virology laboratory database

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is one of the etiological pathogens leading to hand foot and mouth disease HFMD which can cause severe neurological complications The neuropathogenesis of EV A71 infection is not well understood The mislocalization and aggregation of TAR DNA binding protein 43 TDP 43 is the pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS However whether TDP 43 was impacted by EV A71 infection is unknown This study demonstrated that TDP 43 was cleaved during EV A71 infection The cleavage of TDP 43 requires EV A71 replication rather than the activated caspases due to viral infection TDP 43 is cleaved by viral protease 3C between the residues 331Q and 332S while mutated TDP 43 Q331A was not cleaved In addition mutated 3C which lacks the protease activity failed to induce TDP 43 cleavage We also found that TDP 43 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the mislocalization of TDP 43 was induced by viral protease 2A rather than 3C Taken together we demonstrated that TDP 43 was cleaved by viral protease and translocated to the cytoplasm during EV A71 infection implicating the possible involvement of TDP 43 in the pathogenesis of EV A71infection

Coxsackievirus 6 CV A6 has been emerging as another predominant serotype for severe hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in China after the introduction of enterovirus 71 inactivated vaccine EV71 vaccine for 3 years Data on the risk factors for severe HFMD infected with CV A6 are limited We interviewed the caregivers to collected data on HFMD patients who sought medical care in the People s Hospital of Baoan district Shenzhen from 2015 to 2017 Totally 131 severe patients were frequency matched by age and gender with 174 mild patients infected with CV A6 Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the risk factors for severe CV A6 HFMD The average age was 20 62 14 18 months and 20 52 12 76 months for severe and mild patients respectively Multivariate analyses indicated complications at birth odds ratio OR 4 18 95 confidence interval CI 1 64 10 63 peak body temperature over 39 C OR 4 04 95 CI 2 29 7 10 and first born child OR 2 17 95 CI 1 27 3 70 increased the risk of severe HFMD infected with CV A6 Breastfeeding OR 0 52 95 CI 0 32 0 87 and washing hands after playing frequently OR 0 58 95 CI 0 34 0 97 were negatively associated with severe illness Compared with HFMD with infection of EV A71 complications at birth and first born child were newly found to be associated with severe illness in HFMD patients infected with CV A6

Enteroviruses EVs species A are a major public health issue in the Asia Pacific region and cause frequent epidemics of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in China Mild infections are common in children however HFMD can also cause severe illness that affects the central nervous system To molecularly characterize EVs a prospective HFMD virological surveillance program was performed in China between 2013 and 2016 Throat swabs rectal swabs and stool samples were collected from suspected HFMD patients at participating hospitals EVs were detected using generic real time and nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions RT PCRs Then the complete VP1 regions of enterovirus A71 EV A71 coxsackievirus A16 CVA16 and CVA6 were sequenced to analyze amino acid changes and construct a viral molecular phylogeny Of the 2836 enrolled HFMD patients 2 517 89 were EV positive The most frequently detected EVs were CVA16 32 5 819 CVA6 31 2 785 and EV A71 20 4 514 The subgenogroups CVA16_B1b CVA6_D3a and EV A71_C4a were predominant in China and recombination was not observed in the VP1 region Sequence analysis revealed amino acid variations at the 30 29 and 44 positions in the VP1 region of EV A71 CVA16 and CVA6 compared to the respective prototype strains BrCr G10 and Gdula respectively Furthermore in 21 of 24 87 5 identified EV A71 samples a known amino acid substitution D31N that may enhance neurovirulence was detected Our study provides insights about the genetic characteristics of common HFMD associated EVs However the emergence and virulence of the described mutations require further investigation

The coronavirus disease COVID 19 pandemic is an important health crisis worldwide Several strategies were implemented to combat COVID 19 including wearing masks hand hygiene and social distancing The impact of these strategies on COVID 19 and other viral infections remains largely unclear

Enteroviruses are small RNA viruses that affect millions of people each year by causing an important burden of disease with a broad spectrum of symptoms In routine diagnostic laboratories enteroviruses are identified by PCR based methods often combined with partial sequencing for genotyping In this proof of principle study we assessed direct RNA sequencing DRS using nanopore sequencing technology for fast whole genome sequencing of viruses directly from clinical samples The approach was complemented by sequencing the corresponding viral cDNA via Illumina MiSeq sequencing DRS of total RNA extracted from three different enterovirus positive stool samples produced long RNA fragments covering between 59 and 99 6 of the most similar reference genome sequences The identification of the enterovirus sequences in the samples was confirmed by short read cDNA sequencing Sequence identity between DRS and Illumina MiSeq enterovirus consensus sequences ranged between 94 and 97 Here we show that nanopore DRS can be used to correctly identify enterovirus genotypes from patient stool samples with high viral load and that the approach also provides rich metatranscriptomic information on sample composition for all life domains

Gastrointestinal diseases including diarrhoea constitute a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children especially in developing countries Worldwide deaths among all ages due to diarrhoea during 2015 were estimated to be about 1 31 million diarrhoeal deaths in children below 5 years of age being 499 000 Rotavirus accounted for about 200 000 deaths Although diarrhoeal deaths decreased significantly during the last two decades they still represent the third largest cause of infantile deaths Several bacterial viral parasitic fungal and non infectious diarrhoea causing agents have been identified but 30 to 40 of diarrhoeal cases remain undiagnosed Enteroviruses transmit by the faecal oral route and replicate first in intestinal cells before spreading to the target organ They have been associated with diarrhoea in a few studies but their causative role in diarrhoea in humans has not been systematically demonstrated In view of the recent demonstration that enteroviruses cause diarrhoea in newborn mice pups thus validating Koch s postulates the purpose of this review is to emphasise the importance of recognising enteroviruses as major gastrointestinal pathogens associated with acute and persistent diarrhoea and non diarrhoeal increased frequency of bowel movements in infants young children and adults Our studies and several other subsequent studies reported from different countries should stimulate strategies to reduce the burden of infantile gastrointestinal disease which has hitherto remained unaddressed

The FilmArray Respiratory Panel with multiplex targets for respiratory pathogens has been widely used and verified in clinical trials in special test settings However it is necessary to evaluate the panel s performance at the point of care directly in nonspecific test settings

Many animal viruses replicate and are released from cells in close association to membranes However whether this is a passive process or is controlled by the virus remains poorly understood Importantly the genetic basis and evolvability of membrane associated viral shedding have not been investigated To address this we performed a directed evolution experiment using coxsackievirus B3 a model enterovirus in which we repeatedly selected the free virion or the fast sedimenting membrane associated viral subpopulations The virus responded to this selection regime by reproducibly fixing a series of mutations that altered the extent of membrane associated viral shedding as revealed by full genome ultra deep sequencing Specifically using site directed mutagenesis we showed that substitution N63H in the viral capsid protein VP3 reduced the ratio of membrane associated to free viral particles by 2 orders of magnitude These findings open new avenues for understanding the mechanisms and implications of membrane associated viral transmission

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is the most commonly implicated causative agent of severe outbreaks of paediatric hand foot and mouth disease HFMD VP1 protein a capsid protein of EV71 is responsible for the genotype of the virus and is essential for vaccine development and effectiveness However the genotypes of EV71 isolates in China are still not completely clear

In Pakistan annual poliovirus investment decisions drive quantities of supplemental immunization campaigns districts receive In this article we assess whether increased spending on poliovirus surveillance is associated with greater likelihood of correctly identifying districts at high risk of polio with assignment of an elevated risk ranking We reviewed programmatic documents from Pakistan for the period from 2012 2017 recording whether districts had been classified as high risk or low risk in each year Through document review we developed a decision tree to describe the ranking decisions Then integrating data from the World Health Organization and Global Polio Eradication Initiative we constructed a Bayesian decision network reflecting investments in polio surveillance and immunization campaigns surveillance metrics disease incidence immunization rates and occurrence of polio cases We test these factors for statistical association with the outcome of interest a change in risk rank between the beginning and the end of the one year time period We simulate different spending scenarios and predict their impact on district risk ranking in future time periods We find that per district spending increases are associated with increased identification of cases of acute flaccid paralysis AFP However the low specificity of AFP investment and the largely invariant ranking of district risk means that even large increases in surveillance spending are unlikely to promote major changes in risk rankings at the current stage of the Pakistan polio eradication campaign

Hand Foot and Mouth disease HFMD is a mild exanthematous and febrile disease occurs in children aged 10 years old The present study highlights clinical epidemiological characteristics distribution of enterovirus EV types and sub genotypes in HFMD cases reported during 2017 to 2018 in Western India A total of 93 clinical samples collected from 68 HFMD cases were included The presence of EV RNA was determined by 5 UTR based nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by molecular typing sub genotyping by VP1 2A junction or VP1 full VP1 gene amplification and phylogenetic analysis The study reports 80 64 75 93 EV positivity and 94 66 71 75 typing rate with a predominant circulation of CVA16 and CVA6 strains Sequence analysis revealed the presence of coxsackievirus CV A16 57 7 CVA6 40 8 and Echo1 1 4 strains EV infections were predominantly observed in children aged 1 to 3 years old 43 9 Although cases were reported throughout the year peaked in July 15 8 and August 24 6 months and persisted till September 19 3 All the CVA16 and CVA6 positive strains were genotyped using full VP1 gene amplification All CVA16 Indian strains n 41 were clustered with rarely reported B1c sub genotype and CVA6 strains n 29 with E2 sub lineage The study highlights the genetic characteristics of circulating CVA16 CVA6 and Echo1 strains in HFMD cases from Western India The emergence of CVA16 B1c genotype and sub lineage E2 of CVA6 strains and their constant circulation further demands systemic surveillance studies on HFMD from different parts of India to facilitate the rapid diagnosis of CVA16 and CVA6 strains using the molecular and serological based approach and for intervention strategies

Acute flaccid myelitis AFM is a serious neurologic condition that causes limb weakness or paralysis in previously healthy children Since clusters of cases were first reported in 2014 nationwide surveillance has demonstrated sharp increases in AFM cases in the United States every 2 years most occurring during late summer and early fall Given this current biennial pattern another peak AFM season is expected during fall 2020 in the United States Scientific understanding of the etiology and the factors driving the biennial increases in AFM has advanced rapidly in the past few years although areas of uncertainty remain The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and AFM partners are focused on answering key questions about AFM epidemiology and mechanisms of disease This article summarizes the current understanding of AFM etiology and outlines priorities for surveillance and research as we prepare for a likely surge in cases in 2020

The modern world has no available drugs for the treatment of enteroviruses EV which affect millions of people worldwide each year The EV71 is a major causative disease for hand foot and mouth disease sometimes it is associated with severe central nervous system diseases Treatment for enteroviral infection is mainly supportive treatment for aseptic meningitis caused by enteroviruses is also generally symptomatic Upon the urgent request of new anti enterovirus drugs a series of hinged aromatic compounds with polynulei were synthesized through two different chemical pathways Among these morpholine furan thiophene pyrrole benzene pyrazole conjugates three new agents exhibited inhibitory activity with EC

Coxsackievirus A24 variant CVA24v and human adenovirus 37 HAdV 37 are leading causative agents of the severe and highly contagious ocular infections acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis respectively Currently neither vaccines nor antiviral agents are available for treating these diseases which affect millions of individuals worldwide CVA24v and HAdV 37 utilize sialic acid as attachment receptors facilitating entry into host cells Previously we and others have shown that derivatives based on sialic acid are effective in preventing HAdV 37 binding and infection of cells Here we designed and synthesized novel pentavalent sialic acid conjugates and studied their inhibitory effect against CVA24v and HAdV 37 binding and infection of human corneal epithelial cells The pentavalent conjugates are the first reported inhibitors of CVA24v infection and proved efficient in blocking HAdV 37 binding Taken together the pentavalent conjugates presented here form a basis for the development of general inhibitors of these highly contagious ocular pathogens

Enterovirus 71 EV71 induced T lymphocyte apoptosis plays an important role in hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and granzyme B GZMB has been shown to be critical for this process However the mechanisms underlying GZMB mediated apoptosis of T lymphocytes remain unknown In this study we investigated whether transcription factors and microRNAs miRNAs are involved in GZMB mediated apoptosis of T lymphocytes in response to EV71 infection Our findings indicated that EV71 infection significantly induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells a human T lymphocytes cell line as revealed in flow cytometric analysis Furthermore EV71 increased the expression of pro apoptosis Bcl 2 associated X Bax and cleaved caspase 3 but decreased the expression of anti apoptosis B cell lymphoma protein 2 Bcl2 GZMB knockdown decreased cell apoptosis and prevented EV71 induced changes in the expression of Bax cleaved caspase 3 and Bcl2 in Jurkat cells highlighting the role of GZMB as a key factor in EV71 induced apoptosis Our study also indicated that overexpression of the transcription factors GATA binding factor 1 GATA1 and specificity protein 1 SP1 significantly increased luciferase activity when this gene was inserted in the GZMB 3 untranslated region 3 UTR GATA1 SP1 overexpression induced cell apoptosis increased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase 3 and decreased the expression of Bcl2 Finally our results suggested that miR 874 plays an essential role in GZMB mediated cell apoptosis since an miR 874 mimic decreases the expression of GZMB by targeting its 3 UTR Collectively these data indicated that GATA1 SP1 and miR 874 mediate EV71 induced apoptosis in a granzyme B dependent manner This signaling pathway may provide a new pharmacological target for the prevention and treatment of HFMD

Multiple viruses are implicated in atherosclerosis but the mechanisms by which they infect cells and contribute to plaque formation in arterial walls are not well understood Based on reports showing the presence of enterovirus in atherosclerotic plaques we hypothesized that the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor CXADR CAR although absent in normal arteries could be induced during plaque formation Large scale microarray and mass spectrometric analyses revealed significant up regulation of CXADR messenger RNA and protein levels in plaque invested carotid arteries compared with control arteries Macrophages were identified as a previously unknown cellular source of CXADR in human plaques and plaques from Ldr Apob100 100 mice CXADR was specifically associated with M1 polarized macrophages and foam cells and was experimentally induced during macrophage differentiation Furthermore it was significantly correlated with receptors for other viruses linked to atherosclerosis The results show that CXADR is induced in macrophages during plaque formation suggesting a mechanism by which enterovirus infect cells in atherosclerotic plaques

Enterovirus D68 EVD68 is an emerging pathogen that recently caused a large worldwide outbreak of severe respiratory disease in children However the relationship between EVD68 and host cells remains unclear Caspases are involved in cell death immune response and even viral production We found that caspase 3 was activated during EVD68 replication to induce apoptosis Caspase 3 inhibitor Z DEVD FMK inhibited viral production protected host cells from the cytopathic effects of EVD68 infection and prevented EVD68 from regulating the host cell cycle at G0 G1 Meanwhile caspase 3 activator PAC 1 increased EVD68 production EVD68 infection therefore activates caspase 3 for virus production This knowledge provides a potential direction for the prevention and treatment of disease related to EVD68

Infection with viruses especially rotavirus norovirus astrovirus and adenovirus has been known to be a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age globally particularly in developing countries Also some genotypes of enteroviruses EVs have been reported to be associated with gastroenteritis This study is aimed to investigate the prevalence and genotype diversity of EV in children admitted to hospitals with acute gastroenteritis

Human Endogenous Retrovirus W Envelope HERV W ENV mRNA or protein can be found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs and exocrine pancreas of patients with type 1 diabetes T1D Further previous observations have shown an association between enteroviral infection and development of T1D specifically coxsackievirus B CV B has been detected in the blood and pancreas of patients with T1D Notably viruses can activate HERV W expression Hence we evaluated the effect of CV B4 infection on HERV W

Receptor usage that determines cell tropism and drives viral classification closely correlates with the virus structure Enterovirus B EV B consists of several subgroups according to receptor usage among which echovirus 30 E30 a leading causative agent for human aseptic meningitis utilizes FcRn as an uncoating receptor However receptors for many EVs remain unknown Here we analyzed the atomic structures of E30 mature virion empty and A particles which reveals serotype specific epitopes and striking conformational differences between the subgroups within EV Bs Of these the VP1 BC loop markedly distinguishes E30 from other EV Bs indicative of a role as a structural marker for EV B By obtaining cryo electron microscopy structures of E30 in complex with its receptor FcRn and CD55 and comparing its homologs we deciphered the underlying molecular basis for receptor recognition Together with experimentally derived viral receptor identifications we developed a structure based in silico algorithm to inform a rational prediction for EV receptor usage

The incidence of enteric viruses in treated wastewater and their potential release into the environment or use for agriculture are very critical matters in public health In our study PCR polymerase chain reaction analysis of enteric viruses was performed on 59 samples of influents and effluents collected from Tubli wastewater treatment plant Water Pollution Control Center WPCC and Tubli Bay where the effluents were discharged in Kingdom of Bahrain during two sampling periods Four clinically essential waterborne enteric viruses were examined enterovirus EV hepatitis A virus HAV astroviruses AV and rotaviruses RV and compared to standard bacterial and bacteriophages indicators of fecal pollution Detection rates of EV AV HAV and RV in the influent samples were 100 75 12 5 and 12 5 respectively while 50 of the effluent samples from Tubli WPCC contained only EV RNA None of the tested enteric viruses could be detected in any of the samples collected directly from Tubli Bay Effluent samples from Tubli plant did not show significant seasonal differences Since detection of enteric viruses genome does not necessarily indicate infectivity the infectivity of these viruses was evaluated through isolation and growth of indictor bacteria and bacteriophages High concentration of fecal bacteriological indicators was detected in all effluents samples 100 3 20 10

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative since 1988 has seen the impact of poliovirus decline from frequent global epidemics in the early 1900s to being now only endemic in two countries today Global vaccination programmes and surveillance for the disease have resulted in the landmark eradication of two of the three poliovirus strains in the last 5 years Australia continues to contribute to global surveillance efforts for the disease via the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit and the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance Network which aim to detect cases of acute flaccid paralysis in children the key clinical feature of poliomyelitis Today in the era of the polio endgame there is growing recognition of non polio enteroviruses causing paralytic diseases that are polio like particularly in children with an increased need for awareness and vigilance by paediatric clinicians

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is a leading cause of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and can be associated with severe neurological complications EV A71 strains can be classified into seven genogroups A H on the basis of the VP1 capsid protein gene sequence Genogroup A includes the prototype strain genogroups B and C are responsible of major outbreaks worldwide but little is known about the others particularly genogroups E and F which have been recently identified in Africa and Madagascar respectively The circulation of EV A71 in the African region is poorly known and probably underestimated A rapid and specific assay for detecting all genogroups of EV A71 is required In this study we developed a real time RT PCR assay with a competitive internal control IC The primers and

We found an association between the abundance of rodents in the wild and onset of type 1 diabetes T1D in humans A picornavirus named Ljungan virus LV was subsequently isolated from wild bank voles Both picornavirus like particles detected by electron microscopy and LV antigen visualized by immunohistochemistry was seen in islets of Langerhans in diabetic wild bank voles LV antigen has also been found in islets of Langerhans in a patient with recent onset of T1D and in the commonly used Bio Breeding BB T1D rat model We discuss the possibility of T1D and type 2 diabetes T2D as parts of a single disease entity Antiviral compounds directed against picornavirus have been found to be an effective treatment of diabetes in BB rats We propose using the same currently available antiviral compounds in clinical trials in humans Antiviral treatment would have the potential to be both proof of concept for involvement of a picornavirus in diabetes pathogenesis and also present a first generation therapy

An outbreak of the hand foot mouth disease with severe neurological cases mainly caused by the genotype C1 enterovirus A71 EV A71 occurred in Taiwan between 2018 and early 2019 In the recent decade the most dominant EV A71 genotypes in Taiwan were B5 and C4 but changed to C1 in 2018 Antibody mediated immunity plays a key role in limiting the EV A71 illness in humans However the level of neutralizing activities against genotype C1 virus by human polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies MAbs remains largely unclear In the study we demonstrated that that 39 9 in 23 of post infection sera from the genotype B5 or C4 infected patients in 2014 2017 exhibit reduced titers with the 2018 2019 genotype C1 viruses than with the earlier B5 and C4 viruses tested This finding with polyclonal sera is confirmed with human MAbs derived from genotype B5 virus infected individuals The 2018 2019 genotype C1 virus is resistant to the majority of canyon targeting human MAbs which may be associated with the residue change near or at the bottom of the canyon region on the viral capsid The remaining three antibodies 16 2 11B 16 3 4D and 17 1 12A which target VP1 S241 on the 5 fold vertex VP3 E81 on the 3 fold plateau and VP2 D84 on the 2 fold plateau of genotype C1 viral capsid respectively retained neutralizing activities with variable potencies These neutralizing antibodies were also found to be protective against a lethal challenge of the 2018 2019 genotype C1 virus in an hSCARB2 transgenic mice model These results indicate that the EV A71 specific antibody response may consist of a fraction of poorly neutralizing antibodies against 2018 2019 genotype C1 viruses among a subset of previously infected individuals Epitope mapping of protective antibodies that recognize the emerging genotype C1 virus has implications for anti EV A71 MAbs and the vaccine field

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing can detect nucleic acids from bacteria fungi viruses and or parasites in clinical specimens however little data exist to guide its optimal application to clinical practice We retrospectively reviewed results of shotgun metagenomic sequencing testing requested on cerebrospinal fluid samples submitted to an outside reference laboratory from December 2017 through December 2019 Of the 53 samples from Mayo Clinic patients 47 were requested by neurologists with infectious diseases consultation in 23 cases The majority of patients presented with difficult to diagnose subacute or chronic conditions Positive results were reported for 9 17 Mayo Clinic patient samples with 6 interpreted as likely contamination Potential pathogens reported included bunyavirus human herpesvirus 7 and enterovirus D 68 ultimately impacting care in two cases Twenty seven additional samples were submitted from Mayo Clinic Laboratories reference clients with positive results reported for three 11 two with potential pathogens West Nile virus and

Comprehensive genome wide analysis has revealed the presence of translational elements in the 3 untranslated regions UTRs of human transcripts However the mechanisms by which translation is initiated in 3 UTRs and the physiological function of their products remain unclear This study showed that eIF4G drives the translation of various downstream open reading frames dORFs in 3 UTRs The 3 UTR of GCH1 which encodes GTP cyclohydrolase 1 contains an internal ribosome entry site IRES that initiates the translation of dORFs An in vitro reconstituted translation system showed that the IRES in the 3 UTR of GCH1 required eIF4G and conventional translation initiation factors except eIF4E for AUG initiated translation of dORFs The 3 UTR of GCH1 mediated translation was resistant to the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1 which inhibits cap dependent initiation by increasing eIF4E unbound eIF4G eIF4G was also required for the activity of various elements including polyU and poliovirus type 2 a short element thought to recruit ribosomes by base pairing with 18S rRNA These findings indicate that eIF4G mediates translation initiation of various ORFs in mammalian cells suggesting that the 3 UTRs of mRNAs may encode various products

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 which belongs to the family Picornaviridae can invade the central nervous system CNS and cause severe CNS complications or death The EV A71 antigen has been detected in the neurons in the brains of humans who died from EV A71 infection However the effect of EV A71 infection on human neuronal cells remains poorly understood Human neural stem cells NSCs and IMR 32 neuroblastoma cells were differentiated into neuronal cells for this study Although the neuronal cells were permissive to EV A71 infection EV A71 infection did not induce an obvious cytopathic effect on the neuronal cells EV A71 infection did not induce apoptosis in neuronal cells However autophagy and autophagic flux were induced in EV A71 infected neuronal cells The production of autophagosomes was shown to be important for EV A71 viral RNA vRNA replication in neuronal cells

The potential role of enteric viral infections and the developing infant virome in affecting immune responses to the oral poliovirus vaccine OPV is unknown Here we performed viral metagenomic sequencing on 3 serially collected stool samples from 30 Bangladeshi infants following OPV vaccination and compared findings to stool samples from 16 age matched infants in the United States US In 14 Bangladeshi infants available post vaccination serum samples were tested for polio neutralizing antibodies The abundance p 0 006 and richness p 0 013 of the eukaryotic virome increased with age and were higher than seen in age matched US infants p 0 001 In contrast phage diversity metrics remained stable and were similar to those in US infants Non poliovirus eukaryotic virus abundance 3 68 log

Since 2014 cases of acute flaccid myelitis AFM have been reported in the United States in increasing numbers biennially occurring in the late summer and early fall Although there is unlikely to be a single causative agent of this syndrome non polio enteroviruses including enterovirus D 68 EV D68 have had epidemiological and laboratory associations with AFM Much remains to be known about AFM and AFM associated enteroviruses including disease pathogenesis and the best strategies for development of therapeutics or preventive modalities including vaccines To catalyze research that addresses these scientific and clinical gaps the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases convened a workshop entitled AFM Preparedness Addressing EV D68 and Other AFM Associated Enteroviruses on 19 20 February 2020

Coxsackievirus A8 CV A8 is one of the pathogens associated with hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and herpangina HA occasionally leading to severe neurological disorders such as acute flaccid paralysis AFP Only one study aimed at CV A8 has been published to date and only 12 whole genome sequences are publicly available In this study complete genome sequences from 11 CV A8 strains isolated from HFMD patients in extensive regions from China between 2013 and 2018 were determined and all sequences from GenBank were retrieved A phylogenetic analysis based on a total of 34 complete

Enterovirus 71 EV A71 and coxsackievirus A16 CV A16 are the major pathogens responsible for hand foot and mouth disease HFMD but the mechanism by which these viruses cause disease remains unclear In this study we used transcriptome sequencing technology to investigate changes in the transcriptome profiles after infection with EV A71 and CV A16 in human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells Using systematic bioinformatics analysis we then searched for useful clues regarding the pathogenesis of HFMD As a result a total of 111 common differentially expressed genes were present in both EV A71 and CV A16 infected cells A trend analysis of these 111 genes showed that 91 of them displayed the same trend in EV A71 and CV A16 infection including 49 upregulated genes and 42 downregulated genes These 91 genes were further used to conduct GO pathway and coexpression network analysis It was discovered that enriched GO terms such as histone acetylation and positive regulation of phosphorylation and pathways such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPI anchor biosynthesis and DNA replication might be closely associated with the pathogenic mechanism of these two viruses and key genes such as TBCK and GPC might be involved in the progression of HFMD Finally we randomly selected 10 differentially expressed genes for qRT PCR to validate the transcriptome sequencing data The experimental qRT PCR results were roughly in agreement with the results of transcriptome sequencing Collectively our results provide clues to the mechanism of pathogenesis of HFMD induced by EV A71 and CV A16

Enteroviruses manipulate host membranes to form replication organelles which concentrate viral and host factors to allow for efficient replication However this process has not been well studied in living cells throughout the course of infection To define the dynamic process of enterovirus membrane remodeling of major secretory pathway organelles we have developed plasmid based reporter systems that utilize viral protease dependent release of a nuclear localized fluorescent protein from the endoplasmic reticulum ER membrane during infection while retaining organelle specific fluorescent protein markers such as the ER and Golgi This system thus allows for the monitoring of organelle specific changes induced by infection in real time Using long term time lapse imaging of living cells infected with coxsackievirus B3 CVB we detected reporter translocation to the nucleus beginning 4 h post infection which correlated with a loss of Golgi integrity and a collapse of the peripheral ER Lastly we applied our system to study the effects of a calcium channel inhibitor 2APB on virus induced manipulation of host membranes We found that 2APB treatment had no effect on the kinetics of infection or the percentage of infected cells However we observed aberrant ER structures in CVB infected cells treated with 2APB and a significant decrease in viral dependent cell lysis which corresponded with a decrease in extracellular virus titers Thus our system provides a tractable platform to monitor the effects of inhibitors gene silencing and or gene editing on viral manipulation of host membranes which can help determine the mechanism of action for antivirals

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD recently emerged as a global public threat The licensure of inactivated enterovirus A71 EV A71 vaccine was the first step in using a vaccine to control HFMD New challenges arise from changes in the pathogen spectrum while vaccines directed against other common serotypes are in the preclinical stage The mission of a broad spectrum prevention strategy clearly favors multivalent vaccines The development of multivalent vaccines was attempted via the simple combination of potent monovalent vaccines or the construction of chimeric vaccines comprised of epitopes derived from different virus serotypes The present review summarizes recent advances in HFMD vaccine development and discusses the next steps toward a safe and effective HFMD vaccine that is capable of establishing a cross protective antibody response

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of human rhinoviruses HRVs and the emergence of enterovirus D68 EV D68 in children A total of 322 nasopharyngeal swab samples were provided from children with an initial diagnosis of upper and lower respiratory tract infections A total of 34 and 70 cases were positive for EV D68 and HRV respectively The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the clades A and B are the prevalent genotypes for EV D68 and the HRV positive samples belong to three types including HRV A HRV B and HRV C The results showed that EV D68 and HRV C are circulating in Iran especially in the winter

Since 1997 epidemics of hand foot and mouth disease associated with enterovirus A71 EV A71 have affected children younger than 5 years in the Asia Pacific region including mainland China EV A71 vaccines have been licensed for use in children aged 6 71 months in China but not for infants younger than 6 months We aimed to assess the dynamics of maternal EV A71 antibodies to inform choice of potential vaccination strategies to protect infants younger than 6 months because they have a substantial burden of disease

Influent wastewater and effluent wastewater at the Rya treatment plant in Gothenburg Sweden were continuously monitored for enteric viruses by quantitative PCR qPCR during 1 year Viruses in effluent wastewater were also identified by next generation sequencing NGS in samples collected during spring early summer and winter Samples of incoming wastewater were collected every second week Seasonal variations in viral concentrations in incoming wastewater were found for noroviruses GII sapovirus rotavirus parechovirus and astrovirus Norovirus GI and GIV and Aichi virus were present in various amounts during most weeks throughout the year while hepatitis A virus enterovirus and adenovirus were identified less frequently Fluctuations in viral concentrations in incoming wastewater were related to the number of diagnosed patients The viruses were also detected in treated wastewater however with a 3 to 6 log

Enterovirus EV and parechovirus PeV are leading viral causes of central nervous system CNS infection among hospitalized neonates and young infants yet testing for PeV is not routinely performed The goal of our study was to determine how EV and PeV CSF RT PCR testing impacted the duration of antibiotic use and the length of hospitalization LOS in children 6 months old with suspected CNS infection This retrospective cohort study at Children s Mercy Kansas City evaluated data from patients 6 months old for whom routine CSF EV and PeV reverse transcription PCR RT PCR testing was performed during January 2011 to December 2018 Electronic data were abstracted from the electronic medical record including demographics systemic antimicrobial use imaging data herpes simplex virus HSV testing and overall hospital charges Among 1 926 patients 345 17 9 were RT PCR positive for EV and 172 8 9 were positive for PeV A significantly shorter LOS was observed for patients with EV 51 6 h

Rotavirus A RVA bovine torovirus BToV bovine enterovirus BEV and bovine coronavirus BCV at a bovine farm in Ibaraki prefecture were monitored by one step multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR with the aim of confirming the reduction of viral pathogen indicators A total of 960 bovine fecal samples were collected from calves less than 2 month old within the period from October 2016 to October 2018 every 2 months at the bovine farm In each sampling 40 samples were taken from calves 3 week old or less and 40 samples from calves over 3 week old in principle At the end of September 2017 the farm introduced improvement of hygiene protocols on boots by exchanging boots and appropriate usage of a footbath at the entrance of calf sheds In the comparison of the virus detection by RT PCR prevalence of all 4 viruses was significantly reduced P 0 01 in calves 3 week old or less after the improvement The mortality of calves less than 2 month old was also significantly reduced after the improvement of hygiene protocols These data suggest that the proper control of boots at calf sheds is important perhaps even vital for rearing hygiene measures at bovine farms so as to attain substantial decrease in the prevalence of pathogens

Human rhinoviruses RVs are positive strand RNA viruses that cause respiratory tract disease in children and adults Here we show that the innate immune signaling protein STING is required for efficient replication of members of two distinct RV species RV A and RV C The host factor activity of STING was identified in a genome wide RNA interference RNAi screen and confirmed in primary human small airway epithelial cells Replication of RV A serotypes was strictly dependent on STING whereas RV B serotypes were notably less dependent Subgenomic RV A and RV C RNA replicons failed to amplify in the absence of STING revealing it to be required for a step in RNA replication STING was expressed on phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate PI4P enriched membranes and was enriched in RV A16 compared with RV B14 replication organelles isolated in isopycnic gradients The host factor activity of STING was species specific as murine STING mSTING did not rescue RV A16 replication in STING deficient cells This species specificity mapped primarily to the cytoplasmic ligand binding domain of STING Mouse adaptive mutations in the RV A16 2C protein allowed for robust replication in cells expressing mSTING suggesting a role for 2C in recruiting STING to RV A replication organelles Palmitoylation of STING was not required for RV A16 replication nor was the C terminal tail of STING that mediates IRF3 signaling Despite co opting STING to promote its replication interferon signaling in response to STING agonists remained intact in RV A16 infected cells These data demonstrate a surprising requirement for a key host mediator of innate immunity to DNA viruses in the life cycle of a small pathogenic RNA virus

Although acute gastroenteritis AGE has been reported as a common infectious disease in children there is scarce information about enterovirus EV circulating associated with AGE cases in Brazil The purpose of the present study was to identify and characterize the enteroviruses associated with AGE in children in Belém Brazil A total of 175 stool samples were obtained from children hospitalized revealing the presence of EV in 26 3 46 175 of infections EV type was identified in 78 3 36 46 and EV B species 61 1 22 36 was the most prevalent EV detected followed by EV C 25 9 36 and EV A 13 9 5 36 This study has provided important information about the enterovirus circulation in Pará state Northern Brazil

Previous research suggests that hepatocytes catabolize chemical toxins but do not remove microbial agents which are filtered out by other liver cells Kupffer cells and endothelial cells Here we show that contrary to current understanding hepatocytes trap and rapidly silence type B coxsackieviruses CVBs In genetically wildtype mice this activity causes hepatocyte damage which is alleviated in mice carrying a hepatocyte specific deletion of the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor However in these mutant mice there is a dramatic early rise in blood borne virus followed by accelerated systemic disease and increased mortality Thus wild type hepatocytes act similarly to a sponge for CVBs protecting against systemic illness at the expense of their own survival We speculate that hepatocytes may play a similar role in other viral infections as well thereby explaining why hepatocytes have evolved their remarkable regenerative capacity Our data also suggest that in addition to their many other functions hepatocytes might be considered an integral part of the innate immune system

Combination therapies have become a standard for the treatment for HIV and hepatitis C virus HCV infections They are advantageous over monotherapies due to better efficacy reduced toxicity as well as the ability to prevent the development of resistant viral strains and to treat viral co infections Here we identify new synergistic combinations against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 echovirus 1 EV1 hepatitis C virus HCV and human immunodeficiency virus 1 HIV 1 in vitro We observed synergistic activity of nelfinavir with convalescent serum and with purified neutralizing antibody 23G7 against SARS CoV 2 in human lung epithelial Calu 3 cells We also demonstrated synergistic activity of nelfinavir with EIDD 2801 or remdesivir in Calu 3 cells In addition we showed synergistic activity of vemurafenib with emetine homoharringtonine anisomycin or cycloheximide against EV1 infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells We also found that combinations of sofosbuvir with brequinar or niclosamide are synergistic against HCV infection in hepatocyte derived Huh 7 5 cells and that combinations of monensin with lamivudine or tenofovir are synergistic against HIV 1 infection in human cervical TZM bl cells These results indicate that synergy is achieved when a virus directed antiviral is combined with another virus or host directed agent Finally we present an online resource that summarizes novel and known antiviral drug combinations and their developmental status

Upper respiratory tract infections URTI are the leading causes of childhood morbidities This study investigated etiologies and patterns of URTI among children in Mwanza Tanzania A cross sectional study involving 339 children was conducted between October 2017 and February 2018 Children with features suggestive of URTI such as nasal congestion dry cough painful swallowing and nasal discharge with without fever were enrolled Pathogens were detected from nasopharyngeal and ear swabs by multiplex PCR and culture respectively Full blood count and C reactive protein analysis were also done The median age was 16 IQR 8 34 months Majority 82 3 had fever and nasal congestion 65 5 Rhinitis 55 9 was the commonest diagnosis followed by pharyngitis 19 5 Viruses were isolated in 46 of children the commonest being Rhinoviruses 23 9 Nineteen percent of children had more than 2 viruses Rhinovirus and Enterovirus being the commonest combination The commonest bacteria isolated from ears were Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Children with viral pathogens had significantly right shift of lymphocytes 73 sensitivity Majority 257 339 of children were symptoms free on eighth day Viruses are the commonest cause of URTI with Rhinitis being the common diagnosis Rapid diagnostic assays for URTI pathogens are urgently needed in low income countries to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions which is associated with antibiotic resistance

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 the pathogen responsible for the seasonal hand foot and mouth epidemics can cause significant mortality in infants and young children The vaccine against EV A71 could potentially prevent virus induced neurological complications and mortalities occurring due to the high risk of poliomyelitis like paralysis and fatal encephalitis It is known that polysaccharide purified from

This first in human study NCT03032588 conducted in Belgium evaluated a new inactivated poliovirus vaccines IPV candidate based on Sabin poliovirus strains grown on the high yield PER C6 cell line Healthy adults N 32 were randomized 1 1 to receive a single dose of PER C6 based Sabin IPV sIPV 15 35 112 5 DU dose or conventional Salk IPV cIPV 40 8 32 DU dose Reactogenicity was assessed up to 7 days after vaccination immunogenicity 28 days after vaccination and safety up to 6 months after vaccination Solicited adverse events AEs were mild to moderate no changes of concern in vital signs or safety laboratory values were observed and no severe AEs SAEs or vaccine related unsolicited AEs were reported after vaccination A trend to more frequent solicited AEs after sIPV than after cIPV administration was observed Most participants had preexisting neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types titer 8 which were strongly boosted by sIPV Post vaccination geometric mean titers were high 12 000 and similar across the two vaccination groups Only participants with very high preexisting antibody levels did not show a vaccine induced response defined in seropositive participants as a 4 fold titer increase The 10 initially seronegative titer 8 participants n 5 in each study group seroconverted and all participants had seroprotective antibody levels post vaccination The antibodies elicited by sIPV neutralized both Sabin and Salk poliovirus strains In conclusion the PER C6 based sIPV was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in adults with preexisting antibodies to poliovirus

With CA16 enterovirus 71 is the causative agent of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD which occurs mostly in children under 5 years old and responsible of several outbreaks since a decade Most of the time HFMD is a mild disease but can progress to severe complications such as meningitis brain stem encephalitis acute flaccid paralysis AFP and even death EV71 has been identified in all severe cases Therefore it is actually one of the most public health issues that threatens children s life Formula see text is a protease which plays important functions in EV71 infection To date a lot of Formula see text inhibitors have been tested but none of them has been approved yet Therefore a drug screening is still an utmost importance in order to treat and or prevent EV71 infections This work highlights the EV71 life cycle Formula see text functions and Formula see text inhibitors recently screened It permits to well understand all mechanisms about Formula see text and consequently allow further development of drugs targeting Formula see text Thus this review is helpful for screening of more new Formula see text inhibitors or for designing analogues of well known Formula see text inhibitors in order to improve its antiviral activity

Due to the advanced stage of polio eradication the possible role of non polio enteroviruses NPEVs associated to acute flaccid paralysis AFP cases has been highlighted In this study we described epidemiological aspects of NPEVs infections associated to AFP and explore the viral genetic diversity information still scarce in Brazil From 2005 to 2017 6707 stool samples were collected in the scope of the Brazilian Poliomyelitis Surveillance Program NPEVs were isolated in 359 samples 5 3 and 341 94 9 were genotyped About 46 different NPEV types were identified with the following detection pattern EV B EV A EV C The major EV types were CVA2 CV4 EV A71 CVB3 CVB5 E6 E7 E11 CVA13 and EV C99 which corresponds to 51 6 of the total Uncommon types such as CVA12 EV 90 and CVA11 were also identified Different E6 genogroups were observed prevailing the GenIII despite periods of co circulation and replacement of genogroups along time CVA2 sequences were classified as genotype C and data suggested its dispersion in South American countries CVA13 viruses belonged to cluster B and Venezuelan viruses composed a new putative cluster This study provides extensive information on enterovirus diversity associated with AFP reinforcing the need of tailoring current surveillance strategies to timely monitor emergence re emergence of NPEVs

During the last 25 years swine vesicular disease SVD has occurred in Italy mostly sub clinically Therefore regular testing of fecal samples from suspected holdings and high turnover premises was fundamental to identifying virus circulation and to achieve SVD eradication In this study we evaluated diagnostic performances of six genomic amplification methods using positive fecal samples from 78 different outbreaks 1997 2014 which included different lineages Comparison of three RT PCRs designed to amplify the same 154 nt portion of the gene 3D demonstrated that a conventional and a real time based on SYBR Green detection assay showed the highest diagnostic sensitivity detecting all samples while a real time TaqMan based test missed three cases owing to two mismatches in the probe target sequence Diagnostic and analytical specificities were optimal as 300 negative field samples and other enteroviruses reacted negative Three further evaluated tests previously described were a 3D targeted reverse transcriptase loop mediated isothermal amplification RT LAMP and two real time RT PCRs targeted on the 5 UTR region Here the presence of multiple mismatches in probe and primers reduced the diagnostic performances and two of the assays were unable to detect viruses from one sub lineage These results highlight that the choice of tests using less nucleotide targets significantly contributed to the success of the SVD eradication plan

Duck hepatitis A virus 3 DHAV 3 is a wild endemic virus which seriously endangers the duck industry in China The present study aims to elucidate the mechanism of duck resistance to DHAV 3 infection Both resistant and susceptible ducks were challenged with DHAV 3 in this experiment The histopathological features and serum biochemical indices ALT and AST were analyzed to estimate liver injury status at 6 12 15 and 24 h post infection hpi The dynamic transcriptomes of liver were analyzed to explain the molecular regulation mechanism in ducks against DHAV 3 The result showed that the liver injury in susceptible ducks was more serious than that in the resistant ducks throughout the four time points A total of 2 127 differentially expressed genes DEGs were identified by comparing the transcriptome of the two populations The expression levels of genes involved in innate immune response increased rapidly in susceptible ducks from 12 hpi Similarly the expression of genes involved in cytokine regulation also increased at the same time points while the expression levels of these genes in resistant ducks remained similar between the various time points KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed that the genes involved in cytokine regulation and apoptosis were highly expressed in susceptible ducks than that in resistant ducks suggesting that excessive cytokine storm and apoptosis may partially explain the mechanism of liver injury caused by DHAV 3 infection Besides we found that the

Coxsackievirus A6 CV A6 and Coxsackievirus A10 CV A10 have been emerging as the prevailing serotypes and overtaking Enterovirus A71 EV A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 CV A16 in most areas as main pathogens of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in China since 2013 To investigate whole etiological spectrum following EV A71 vaccination of approximate 40 000 infants and young children in Xiangyang enteroviruses were serotyped in 4415 HFMD cases from October 2016 to December 2017 using Real Time and conventional PCR and cell cultures Of the typeable 3201 specimen CV A6 was the predominant serotype followed by CV A16 CV A10 CV A5 CV A2 and EV A71 with proportions of 59 54 15 31 11 56 4 56 3 78 and 3 03 respectively Other 12 minor serotypes were also detected The results demonstrated that six major serotypes of enteroviruses were co circulating including newly emerged CV A2 and CV A5 A dramatic decrease of EV A71 cases was observed whereas the total cases remained high Multivalent vaccines against major serotypes are urgently needed for control of HFMD

Autophagy is a degradative cellular pathway that targets cytoplasmic contents and organelles for turnover by the lysosome Various autophagy pathways play key roles in the clearance of viral infections and many families of viruses have developed unique methods for avoiding degradation Some positive stranded RNA viruses such as enteroviruses and flaviviruses usurp the autophagic pathway to promote their own replication We previously identified the endoplasmic reticulum ER localized protein BPIFB3 as an important negative regulator of non canonical autophagy that uniquely impacts the replication of enteroviruses and flaviviruses Here we find that many components of the canonical autophagy machinery are not required for BPIFB3 depletion induced autophagy and identify the host factors that facilitate its role in the replication of enteroviruses and flaviviruses Using proximity dependent biotinylation BioID followed by mass spectrometry we identify ARFGAP1 and TMED9 as two cellular components that interact with BPIFB3 to regulate autophagy and viral replication Importantly our data demonstrate that non canonical autophagy in mammalian cells can be controlled outside of the traditional pathway regulators and define the role of two proteins in BPIFB3 depletion mediated non canonical autophagy

We assessed EV D68 epidemiology and phylogenetics among children aged 9 years hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illnesses at five sites in Panama and El Salvador during 2012 2013 Respiratory specimens positive for enterovirus or rhinovirus were tested by real time RT PCR for EV D68 and partial VP1 gene sequences were determined Of 715 enrolled children 17 from sites in both countries were EV D68 positive and commonly had a history of asthma or wheezing Phylogenetically 15 of 16 sequences fell into Clade B1 and one into Clade A2 The Central American EV D68s were closely related genetically to contemporaneous strains from North America South America and the Caribbean

The current methods to study the distribution and dynamics of viral RNA molecules inside infected cells are not ideal as electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry can only detect mature virions and quantitative real time PCR does not reveal localized distribution of RNAs We demonstrated here the branched DNA in situ hybridization bDNA ISH technology to study both the amount and location of the emerging RNA and RNA during acute and persistent enterovirus infections According to our results the replication of the viral RNA started 2 3 h after infection and the translation shortly after at 3 4 h post infection The replication hotspots with newly emerging RNA were located quite centrally in the cell while the RNA production and most likely virion assembly took place in the periphery of the cell We also discovered that the pace of replication of RNA and RNA strands was almost identical and RNA was absent during antiviral treatments ViewRNA ISH with our custom probes also showed a good signal during acute and persistent enterovirus infections in cell and mouse models Considering these results along with the established bDNA FISH protocol modified by us the effects of antiviral drugs and the emergence of enterovirus RNAs in general can be studied more effectively

The SARS CoV 2 pandemic and the likelihood of future coronavirus pandemics has rendered our understanding of coronavirus biology more essential than ever Small molecule chemical probes offer to both reveal novel aspects of virus replication and to serve as leads for antiviral therapeutic development The RNA biased amiloride scaffold was recently tuned to target a viral RNA structure critical for translation in enterovirus 71 ultimately uncovering a novel mechanism to modulate positive sense RNA viral translation and replication Analysis of CoV RNA genomes reveal many conserved RNA structures in the 5 UTR and proximal region critical for viral translation and replication including several containing bulge like secondary structures suitable for small molecule targeting Following phylogenetic conservation analysis of this region we screened an amiloride based small molecule library against a less virulent human coronavirus OC43 to identify lead ligands Amilorides inhibited OC43 replication as seen in viral plaque assays Select amilorides also potently inhibited replication competent SARS CoV 2 as evident in the decreased levels of cell free virions in cell culture supernatants of treated cells Reporter screens confirmed the importance of RNA structures in the 5 end of the viral genome for small molecule activity Finally NMR chemical shift perturbation studies of the first six stem loops of the 5 end revealed specific amiloride interactions with stem loops 4 5a and 6 all of which contain bulge like structures and were predicted to be strongly bound by the lead amilorides in retrospective docking studies Taken together the use of multiple orthogonal approaches allowed us to identify the first small molecules aimed at targeting RNA structures within the 5 UTR and proximal region of the CoV genome These molecules will serve as chemical probes to further understand CoV RNA biology and can pave the way for the development of specific CoV RNA targeted antivirals

Continued emergence and spread of circulating vaccine derived type 2 polioviruses and vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis from Sabin oral poliovirus vaccines OPVs has stimulated development of two novel type 2 OPV candidates OPV2 c1 and OPV2 c2 designed to have similar immunogenicity improved genetic stability and less potential to reacquire neurovirulence We aimed to assess safety and immunogenicity of the two novel OPV candidates compared with a monovalent Sabin OPV in children and infants

Positive strand RNA viruses universally remodel host intracellular membranes to form membrane bound viral replication complexes where viral offspring RNAs are synthesized In the majority of cases viral replication proteins are targeted to and play critical roles in the modulation of the designated organelle membranes Many viral replication proteins do not have transmembrane domains but contain single or multiple amphipathic alpha helices It has been conventionally recognized that these helices serve as an anchor for viral replication protein to be associated with membranes We report here that a peptide representing the amphipathic α helix at the N terminus of the poliovirus 2C protein not only binds to liposomes but also remodels spherical liposomes into tubules The membrane remodeling ability of this amphipathic alpha helix is similar to that recognized in other amphipathic alpha helices from cellular proteins involved in membrane remodeling such as BAR domain proteins Mutations affecting the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic alpha helix severely compromised membrane remodeling of vesicles with physiologically relevant phospholipid composition These mutations also affected the ability of poliovirus to form plaques indicative of reduced viral replication further underscoring the importance of membrane remodeling by the amphipathic alpha helix in possible relation to the formation of viral replication complexes

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 infection has emerged as a significant public health concern atthe global level Epidemic events of EV A71 have been reported worldwide and this succession of outbreaks has heightened concern that EV A71 may become a public health threat In recent years widespread A71 enterovirus also occurred in European countries EV A71 infection causes hand foot mouth disease HFMD herpangina and fever However it can sometimes induce a variety of neurological complications including encephalitis aseptic meningitis pulmonary edema and acute flaccid paralysis We identified new benzimidazole derivatives and described their in vitro cytotoxicity and broad spectrum anti enterovirus activity Among them derivative

Coxsackievirus A5 CV A5 has recently emerged as a main hand foot and mouth disease HFMD pathogen Following a large scale vaccination campaign against enterovirus 71 EV 71 in China the number of HFMD associated cases with EV 71 was reduced especially severe and fatal cases However the total number of HFMD cases remains high as HFMD is also caused by other enterovirus serotypes A multivalent HFMD vaccine containing 4 or 6 antigens of enterovirus serotypes is urgently needed A formaldehyde inactivated CV A5 vaccine derived from Vero cells was used to inoculate newborn Kunming mice on days 3 and 10 The mice were challenged on day 14 with a mouse adapted CV A5 strain at a dose that was lethal for 14 day old suckling mice Within 14 days postchallenge groups of mice immunized with three formulations empty particles EPs full particles FPs and a mixture of the EP and FP vaccine candidates all survived while 100 of the mock immunized mice died Neutralizing antibodies NtAbs were detected in the sera of immunized mice and the NtAb levels were correlated with the survival rate of the challenged mice The virus loads in organs were reduced and pathological changes and viral protein expression were weak or not observed in the immunized mice compared with those in alum inoculated control mice Another interesting finding was the identification of CV A5 dense particles DPs facilitating morphogenesis study These results demonstrated that the Vero cell adapted CV A5 strain is a promising vaccine candidate and could be used as a multivalent HFMD vaccine component in the future

Previous studies have implicated both zinc finger antiviral protein ZAP and oligoadenylate synthetase 3 OAS3 RNase L in the attenuation of RNA viruses with elevated CpG and UpA dinucleotides Mechanisms and interrelationships between these two pathways were investigated using an echovirus 7 E7 replicon with compositionally modified sequences inserted into the 3 untranslated region ZAP and OAS3 immunoprecipitation IP assays provided complementary data on dinucleotide composition effects on binding Elevated frequencies of alternative pyrimidine purine CpA and UpG and reversed GpC and ApU dinucleotides showed no attenuating effect on replication or specific binding to ZAP by IP However the bases 3 and 5 of CpG motifs influenced replication and ZAP binding UCGU enhanced CpG mediated attenuation and ZAP binding while A residues shielded CpGs from ZAP recognition Attenuating effects of elevated frequencies of UpA on replication occurred independently of CpG dinucleotides and bound noncompetitively with CpG enriched RNA consistent with a separate recognition site from CpG Remarkably immunoprecipitation with OAS3 antibody reproduced the specific binding to CpG and UpA enriched RNA sequences However OAS3 and ZAP were coimmunoprecipitated in both ZAP and OAS3 IP and colocalized with E7 and stress granules SGs by confocal microscopy analysis of infected cells ZAP s association with larger cellular complexes may mediate the recruitment of OAS3 RNase L KHNYN and other RNA degradation pathways

C1q TNF related protein 9 CTRP9 is implicated in diverse cardiovascular diseases but its role in viral myocarditis VMC is not well explored This study is aimed at investigating the role and potential mechanism of CTRP9 in VMC Herein we found that the peripheral blood collected from children with VMC had lower CTRP9 levels than that from children who had recovered from VMC H9c2 cardiomyocytes treated with coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 were applied to establish a VMC model

Severe hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a life threatening contagious disease among young children and infants Although enterovirus A71 has been well acknowledged to be the dominant cause of severe HFMD there still remain other unidentified risk factors for severe HFMD Previous studies mainly focused on identifying the individual level risk factors from a clinical perspective while rare studies aimed to clarify the association between regional level risk factors and severe HFMD which may be more important from a public health perspective

Background Coxsackievirus B CVB is the most common cause of viral myocarditis It targets cardiomyocytes through coxsackie and adenovirus receptor which is highly expressed in the fetal heart We hypothesized CVB3 can precipitate congenital heart defects when fetal infection occurs during critical window of gestation Methods and Results We infected C57Bl 6 pregnant mice with CVB3 during time points in early gestation embryonic day E 5 E7 E9 and E11 We used different viral titers to examine possible dose response relationship and assessed viral loads in various fetal organs Provided viral exposure occurred between E7 and E9 we observed characteristic features of ventricular septal defect 33 6 abnormal myocardial architecture resembling noncompaction 23 5 and double outlet right ventricle 4 4 among 209 viable fetuses examined We observed a direct relationship between viral titers and severity of congenital heart defects with apparent predominance among female fetuses Infected dams remained healthy we did not observe any maternal heart or placental injury suggestive of direct viral effects on developing heart as likely cause of congenital heart defects We examined signaling pathways in CVB3 exposed hearts using RNA sequencing Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis and immunohistochemistry Signaling proteins of the Hippo tight junction transforming growth factor β1 and extracellular matrix proteins were the most highly enriched in CVB3 infected fetuses with ventricular septal defects Moreover cardiomyocyte proliferation was 50 lower in fetuses with ventricular septal defects compared with uninfected controls Conclusions We conclude prenatal CVB3 infection induces congenital heart defects Alterations in myocardial proliferate capacity and consequent changes in cardiac architecture and trabeculation appear to account for most of observed phenotypes

Virus induced asthma is prevalent among children but its underlying mechanisms are unclear Accumulated evidence indicates that early life respiratory virus infection increases susceptibility to allergic asthma Nonetheless the relationship between systemic virus infections such as enterovirus infection and the ensuing effects on allergic asthma development is unknown Early life enterovirus infection was correlated with higher risks of allergic diseases in children Adult mice exhibited exacerbated mite allergen induced airway inflammation following recovery from EV A71 infection in the neonatal period Bone marrow derived macrophages BMDMs from recovered EV A71 infected mice showed sustained innate immune memory trained immunity that could drive naïve T helper cells toward Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation when in contact with mites Adoptive transfer of EV A71 trained BMDMs induced augmented allergic inflammation in naïve recipient mice which was inhibited by 2 deoxy D glucose 2 DG pretreatment suggesting that trained macrophages following enterovirus infection are crucial in the progression of allergic asthma later in life

Enteroviruses EVs are RNA viruses that can cause many clinical syndromes including acute flaccid paralysis AFP Within the global polio laboratory network EVs are categorized either as polioviruses or non polio enteroviruses NPEVs Specific NPEVs have been described in polio like residual paralytic events in AFP patients Retrospective analysis of 112 NPEV isolates from AFP patients was performed and thirty one NPEV types were identified of which 91 were Enterovirus B and 9 were Enterovirus A species The NPEVs were distributed across the country with most patients in the eastern region 41 89 46 1 The highest proportion of patients were children less than 5 years 77 89 86 5 and male patients were more common 54 89 60 7 Echovirus 11 11 89 12 4 was frequently observed and phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed high diversity Coxsackievirus B5 CV B5 CV B6 E21 and EV B69 were only seen in patients with residual paralysis Analyses of the EV A71 sequence indicated a unique genogroup

Increasing evidence highlights the importance of the antiviral activities of the type III interferons IFNλs IL 28A IL 28B IL29 and IFNλ4 in the intestine However many viruses have developed strategies to counteract these defense mechanisms by preventing the production of IFNs Here we use infection models a clinical virus isolate and several molecular biology techniques to demonstrate that both type I and III IFNs induce an antiviral state and attenuate Coxsackievirus group B CVB replication in human intestinal epithelial cells IECs While treatment of IECs with a viral mimic poly I C induced a robust expression of both type I and III IFNs no such up regulation was observed after CVB infection The blunted IFN response was paralleled by a reduction in the abundance of proteins involved in the induction of interferon gene transcription including TIR domain containing adapter inducing interferon β TRIF mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS and the global protein translation initiator eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G eIF4G Taken together this study highlights a potent anti Coxsackieviral effect of both type I and III IFNs in cells located at the primary site of infection Furthermore we show for the first time that the production of type I and III IFNs in IECs is blocked by CVBs These findings suggest that CVBs evade the host immune response in order to successfully infect the intestine

Enteroviruses are important causes of hand foot and mouth disease respiratory infections and neurological infections in human A major hurdle for the development of anti enterovirus agents is the lack of physiologically relevant evaluation platforms that closely correlate with the in vivo state We established the human small intestinal organoids as a novel platform for characterizing the viral replication kinetics and evaluating candidate antivirals for enteroviruses The organoids supported productive replication of enterovirus EV A71 coxsackievirus B2 and poliovirus type 3 as evidenced by increasing viral loads infectious virus titers and the presence of cytopathic effects In contrast EV D68 which mainly causes respiratory tract infection in humans did not replicate significantly in the organoids The differential expression profiles of the receptors for these enteroviruses correlated with their replication kinetics Using itraconazole as control we showed that the results of various antiviral assays including viral load reduction plaque reduction and cytopathic effect inhibition assays were highly reproducible in the organoids Moreover itraconazole attenuated virus induced inflammatory response in the organoids which helped to explain its antiviral effects and mechanism Collectively these data showed that the human small intestinal organoids may serve as a robust platform for investigating the pathogenesis and evaluating antivirals for enteroviruses

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 has emerged as a clinically important neurotropic virus following poliovirus eradication Recent studies have shown that human tonsillar epithelial cell lines UT SCC 60A and UT SCC 60B were susceptible to EV A71 suggesting that human tonsillar crypt epithelium could be important in EV A71 pathogenesis However the mechanism about how EV A71 infects the upper oro digestive tract remains largely unclear In this study we demonstrated that the human tonsillar epithelial cells infected with EV A71 underwent apoptotic in which cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria to the cytosol and caspase 9 was activated while caspase 2 and 8 were not cleaved or activated during the infection A selective inhibitor of caspase 9 Z LEHD FMK inhibited the cleavage of the executioner caspase 3 and 7 indicating that only mitochondria mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway was activated in EV A71 infected tonsillar epithelial cells No evidence of pyroptosis or necroptosis was involved in the cell death EV A71 infection induced interferon pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IFN β IL 6 CCL5 and TNF α in tonsillar epithelial cells which may play a critical role in EV A71 caused herpangina Our data indicated that the induction of the cytokines was partially regulated by the mitogen activated protein kinases MAPKs signaling pathway The findings unveiled the host response to EV A71 and its regulation mechanism and will further our understanding the significance about the tonsillar crypt epithelium as the initial and primary portal in viral pathogenesis for EV A71 infection

Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal degradation process and abnormal autophagy has been associated with various pathological processes e g neurodegeneration cancer and pathogen infection Small chemical modulators of autophagy show the potential to treat autophagy associated diseases Diterpenoids nature products found in various plants exhibit a wide range of bioactivity and we have recently isolated and characterized over 150 diterpenoids from Isodon species distributed in China Here we applied a high content fluorescence imaging based assay to assess these diterpenoids ability to affect autophagic flux in HeLa cells We found that enanderinanin J an ent kauranoid dimer is an autophagy inhibitor manifested by its ability to increase lysosomal pH and inhibit the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes Autophagy has been shown to be either positively or negatively involved in the life cycle of Zika virus ZIKV Japanese encephalitis virus JEV Dengue virus DENV and enterovirus A71 EV A71 We found that enanderinanin J significantly inhibited the infection of ZIKV DENV JEV or EV A71 Interestingly although ATG5 knockdown inhibited ZIKV or JEV infection enanderinanin J further inhibited the infection of ZIKV or JEV in ATG5 knockdown cells Taken together our data indicate that enanderinanin J inhibits autophagosome lysosome fusion and is a potential antiviral agent

Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the etiologic agent of the 2020 pandemic outbreak is a betacoronavirus named SARS CoV 2 For public health interventions a diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity is required The gold standard protocol for diagnosis by the Word Health Organization WHO is RT PCR To detect low viral loads and perform large scale screening a low cost diagnostic test is necessary Here we developed a cost effective test capable of detecting SARS CoV 2 We validated an auxiliary protocol for molecular diagnosis with the SYBR Green RT PCR methodology to successfully screen negative cases of SARS CoV 2 Our results revealed a set of primers with high specificity and no homology with other viruses from the Coronovideae family or human respiratory tract pathogenic viruses presenting with complementarity only for rhinoviruses enteroviruses and Legionella spp Optimization of the annealing temperature and polymerization time led to a high specificity in the PCR products We have developed a more affordable and swift methodology for negative SARS CoV 2 screening This methodology can be applied on a large scale to soften panic and economic burden through guidance for isolation strategies

Neonatal echovirus infections are characterized by severe hepatitis and neurological complications that can be fatal Here we show that expression of the human homologue of the neonatal Fc receptor hFcRn the primary receptor for echoviruses and ablation of type I interferon IFN signaling are key host determinants involved in echovirus pathogenesis We show that expression of hFcRn alone is insufficient to confer susceptibility to echovirus infections in mice However expression of hFcRn in mice deficient in type I interferon IFN signaling hFcRn IFNAR recapitulate the echovirus pathogenesis observed in humans Luminex based multianalyte profiling from E11 infected hFcRn IFNAR mice revealed a robust systemic immune response to infection including the induction of type I IFNs Furthermore similar to the severe hepatitis observed in humans E11 infection in hFcRn IFNAR mice caused profound liver damage Our findings define the host factors involved in echovirus pathogenesis and establish in vivo models that recapitulate echovirus disease in humans

Toll like receptors TLRs are essential for the protection of the host from pathogen infections by initiating the integration of contextual cues to regulate inflammation and immunity However without tightly controlled immune responses the host will be subjected to detrimental outcomes Therefore it is important to balance the positive and negative regulations of TLRs to eliminate pathogen infection yet avert harmful immunological consequences This study revealed a distinct mechanism underlying the regulation of the TLR network The expression of sex determining region Y box 4 Sox4 is induced by virus infection in viral infected patients and cultured cells which subsequently represses the TLR signaling network to facilitate viral replication at multiple levels by a distinct mechanism Briefly Sox4 inhibits the production of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 MyD88 and most of the TLRs by binding to their promoters to attenuate gene transcription In addition Sox4 blocks the activities of the TLR MyD88 IRAK4 TAK1 and TLR TRIF TRAF3 TBK1 pathways by repressing their key components Moreover Sox4 represses the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B NF κB through interacting with IKKα α and attenuates NF kB and IFN regulatory factors 3 7 IRF3 7 abundances by promoting protein degradation All these contributed to the down regulation of interferons IFNs and IFN stimulated gene ISG expression leading to facilitate the viral replications Therefore we reveal a distinct mechanism by which viral pathogens evade host innate immunity and discover a key regulator in host defense

Infection with the re emerging enterovirus 71 EV A71 is associated with a wide range of disease severity including herpangina encephalitis and cardiopulmonary failure At present there is no FDA approved therapeutics for EV A71 Early diagnosis for the high risk children is the key to successful patient care We examined viral genome sequences at the 5 untranslated region UTR and the capsid protein VP1 from 36 mild and 27 severe cases We identified five EV A71 mutations associated with severe diseases including 1 the 5 UTR mutations C580U A707G C709U 2 a VP1 alanine to threonine mutation at position 280 280T and 3 a VP1 glutamic acid to non glutamic acid at position 145 145 non E SCARB2 is a known entry receptor for EV A71 Based on a recent cryoEM structure of the EV A71 SCARB2 binding complex VP1 280T is near the binding interface between the VP1 VP2 complex and its entry receptor SCARB2 A

Viral myocarditis is caused by a viral infection and characterized by the inflammation of the myocardium Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 infection is one of the most common among the infections caused by this virus The host s early innate immune response to CVB3 infection particularly depends on the functions of type I interferons IFNs In this study we report that a host microRNA miR 30a was upregulated by CVB3 to facilitate its replication We demonstrated that miR 30a was a potent negative regulator of IFN I signaling by targeting tripartite motif protein 25 TRIM25 In addition we found that TRIM25 overexpression significantly suppressed CVB3 replication whereas

Genetic screens using CRISPR Cas9 have been exploited to discover host virus interactions These screens have identified viral dependencies on host proteins during their life cycle and potential antiviral strategies The acyl CoA binding domain containing 3 ACBD3 was identified as an essential host factor for the Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 infection Other groups have also investigated the role of ACBD3 as a host factor for diverse enteroviruses in cultured cells However it has not been tested if ACBD3 is required in the animal model of CVB3 infection Owing to embryonic lethality conventional knockout mice were not available for in vivo study As an alternative approach we used adeno associated virus AAV mediated CRISPR genome editing to generate mice that lacked ACBD3 within the pancreas the major target organ for CVB3 Delivery of sgRNAs using self complementary sc AAV8 efficiently induced a loss of function mutation in the pancreas of the Cas9 knock in mice Loss of ACBD3 in the pancreas resulted in a 100 fold reduction in the CVB3 titer within the pancreas and a noticeable reduction in viral protein expression These results indicate a crucial function of ACBD3 in CVB3 infection in vivo AAV mediated CRISPR genome editing may be applicable to many in vivo studies on the virus host interaction and identify a novel target for antiviral therapeutics

Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 belongs to the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae and can cause acute acinar pancreatitis in adults However the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying CVB3 induced acute pancreatitis have remained unclear In this study we discovered that CVB3 capsid protein VP1 inhibited pancreatic cell proliferation and exerted strong cytopathic effects on HPAC cells Through yeast two hybrid co immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy we show that Menage a trois 1 MAT1 a subunit of the Cdk Activating Kinase CAK complex involved in cell proliferation and transcription is a novel interaction protein with CVB3 VP1 Moreover CVB3 VP1 inhibited MAT1 accumulation and localization thus interfering with its interaction with CDK7 Furthermore CVB3 VP1 could suppress CAK complex enzymic phosphorylation activity towards RNA Pol II and CDK4 6 direct substrates of CAK VP1 also suppresses phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein pRb an indirect CAK substrate especially at phospho pRb Ser780 and phospho pRb Ser807 811 residues which are associated with cell proliferation Finally we present evidence using deletion mutants that the C terminal domain VP1 D8 768 859aa is the minimal VP1 region required for its interaction with MAT1 and furthermore VP1 D8 alone was sufficient to arrest cells in G1 S phase as observed during CVB3 infection Taken together we demonstrate that CVB3 VP1 can inhibit CAK complex assembly and activity through direct interaction with MAT1 to block MAT1 mediated CAK CDK4 6 Rb signaling and ultimately suppress cell proliferation in pancreatic cells These findings substantially extend our basic understanding of CVB3 mediated pancreatitis providing strong candidates for strategic therapeutic targeting

Human enteroviruses EVs are highly prevalent in sewage and have been associated with human diseases with complications leading to severe neurological syndromes We have used a recently developed molecular method to investigate the presence of EVs in eight samples collected in 2017 2018 from water streams contaminated by drainage channels in three different locations in Nigeria A total of 93 human EV strains belonging to 45 different serotypes were identified far exceeding the number of strains and serotypes found in similar samples in previous studies Next generation sequencing analysis retrieved whole capsid genomic nucleotide sequences of EV strains belonging to all four A B C and D species Our results further demonstrate the value of environmental surveillance for the detection of EV transmission of both serotypes commonly associated with clinical syndromes such as EV A71 and those that appear to circulate silently but could eventually cause outbreaks and disease Several uncommon serotypes rarely reported elsewhere were detected such as EV A119 EV B87 EV C116 and EV D111 Ten EV serotypes were detected in Nigeria for the first time and two of them CV A12 and EV B86 firstly described in Africa This method can be expanded to generate whole genome EV sequences as we show here for one EV D111 strain Our data revealed phylogenetic relationships of Nigerian sewage strains with EV strains reported elsewhere mostly from African origin and provided new insights into the whole genome structure of emerging serotype EV D111 and recombination events among EV D serotypes

While hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is primarily self resolving soaring incidence rate of symptomatic HFMD effectuates economic burden in the Asia Pacific region Singapore has seen a conspicuous rise in the number of HFMD cases from 2010s Here we aims to identify the serology and genotypes responsible for such outbreaks in hospitals and childcare facilities

Surveillance of recombinant enterovirus 71 EV71 and subgenotype replacement is vital for preventing and controlling hand foot and mouth disease HFMD outbreaks Despite this data on recombinant variants and phylogeny of circulating EV71 strains in mainland China are limited In this study recombinant variants of EV71 were identified in mainland China from 2009 to 2018 Phylogenetic analysis indicated that except for individual strains CQ2014 86 CQ CHN 2014 and EV71 Xiamen 2009 B5 almost all of the EV71 strains in mainland China belonged to the subgenotype C4a Analysing complete genome sequences of 196 EV71 isolates 3 intertypic recombination strains VR1432 30 2 2015 BJ and Guangdong 2009 and 5 intratypic recombination strains EV71 P1034 2013 VR1432 Henan ZMD CHN 2012 Hubei WH CHN 2012 and EV71 P868 2013 China were identified among naturally circulating EV71 The breakpoints of these recombinant strains were located within the P1 P2 and P3 encoding regions Notably a double recombinant VR1432 resulting from recombination between EV71 subgenotype C4a and C4b strain SHZH98 and a CA8 strain Donovan was identified This study reports these specific intertypic and intratypic recombination events for the first time highlighting the importance of genetic recombination in the emergence of new enterovirus variants

Enterovirus B75 EV B75 is a newly identified serotype of the enterovirus B species To date only 112 cases related to EV B75 have been reported worldwide and research on EV B75 is still limited with only two full length genome sequences available in GenBank The present study reported seven EV B75 sequences from a child with acute flaccid paralysis and six asymptomatic close contacts in Shigatse Tibet Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Tibetan strain was possibly imported from neighboring India Seroepidemiological analyses indicated that EV B75 has not yet caused a large scale epidemic in Tibet Similarity plots and boot scanning analyses revealed frequent intertypic recombination in the non structural region of all seven Tibet EV B75 strains All seven Tibetan strains were temperature sensitive suggesting their poor transmissibility in the environment Overall though the seven Tibetan strains did not cause large scale infection prevention and control of the novel enterovirus cannot be underestimated

Viruses are the most frequent cause of severe acute respiratory infection SARI in children It is currently unknown whether presence of a virus the number of viruses or type of virus are associated with clinical outcomes of pediatric SARI in developing countries

While the underlying determinants are unclear hand foot and mouth disease HFMD presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations with varying severity in different individuals Recently many studies identified the human microbiome as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various diseases Therefore we here investigated the ecological dynamics of the oral microbiome changes during the HFMD infection After targeted enrichment of all known vertebrate viruses the virome profiles of symptomatic and asymptomatic HFMD patients were examined and revealed to be significantly altered from those of healthy individuals with nine discriminative viruses detected Further characterization of the prokaryotic microbiome revealed an elevated level of Streptococcus sp as the most important signature of the symptomatic HFMD cohort positively correlating to the level of enterovirus A RNA In addition we found that while coxsackievirus A5 is detected in saliva RNA of all asymptomatic cases coxsackievirus A6 dominates the majority of the symptomatic cohort

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is an important pathogen of severe hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in young children This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the molecular epidemiology and recombination of EV A71 in mainland China during 1987 2017 Phylogenetic tree showed that besides the previously reported subgenotypes A B5 C0 C2 C3 and C4 a new subgenotype C6 emerged in mainland China Recombination analysis indicated that C4 EV A71 was derived from a common ancestor as a double recombinant virus by intertypic recombination between C EV A71 and CVA4 CVA5 CVA14 and CVA16 strains in P3 region and intratypic recombination between C and B EV A71 strains in P2 region The B5 EV A71 shared high similarity with C EV A71 in P1 region while it contained an unidentified sequence in P2 and P3 regions with two possible recombination patterns one occurred between C4 EV A71 and CVA3 CVA5 CVA6 CVA10 and CVA12 stains with one breakpoint in 3C and the other occurred between C1 C2 C3 and C5 EV A71 and CVA4 CVA5 CVA14 and CVA16 strains with two breakpoints in the 2A 2B junction and 3C The C2 EV A71 was probably a recombinant virus between C4 EV A71 and CVA8 strains with two breakpoints located in the 5 UTR and 2A 2B junction Moreover an incredible recombination of C6 EV A71 occurred between C4 and C2 EV A71 with multiple breakpoints Thus continuous studies on EV A71 genome characteristics are still useful and essential for monitoring emergence of new viruses and preventing HFMD outbreaks

Enteroviruses such as EV A71 and CVA16 mainly infect the human gastrointestinal tract Human coronaviruses including SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 have been variably associated with gastrointestinal symptoms We aimed to optimize the human intestinal organoids and hypothesize that these optimized intestinal organoids can recapitulate enteric infections of enterovirus and coronavirus We demonstrate that the optimized human intestinal organoids enable better simulation of the native human intestinal epithelium and that they are significantly more susceptible to EV A71 than CVA16 Higher replication of EV A71 than CVA16 in the intestinal organoids triggers a more vigorous cellular response However SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 exhibit distinct dynamics of virus host interaction more robust propagation of SARS CoV triggers minimal cellular response whereas SARS CoV 2 exhibits lower replication capacity but elicits a moderate cellular response Taken together the disparate profile of the virus host interaction of enteroviruses and coronaviruses in human intestinal organoids may unravel the cellular basis of the distinct pathogenicity of these viral pathogens

Enteroviruses pose a persistent and widespread threat to human physical health with no specific treatments available Small molecule capsid binders have the potential to be developed as antivirals that prevent virus attachment and entry into host cells To aid with broad range drug development we report here structures of coxsackieviruses B3 and B4 bound to different interprotomer targeting capsid binders using single particle cryo EM The EM density maps are beyond 3 Å resolution providing detailed information about interactions in the ligand binding pocket Comparative analysis revealed the residues that form a conserved virion stabilizing network at the interprotomer site and showed the small molecule properties that allow anchoring in the pocket to inhibit virus disassembly

The emergence of SARS CoV 2 and subsequent COVID 19 pandemic highlights the morbidity and potential disease severity caused by respiratory viruses To elucidate pathogen prevalence etiology of coinfections and URIs from symptomatic adult Emergency department patients in a pre SARS CoV 2 environment we evaluated specimens from four geographically diverse Emergency departments in the United States from 2013 2014 utilizing ePlex RP RUO cartridges Genmark Diagnostics The overall positivity was 30 1 241 799 with 6 6 16 241 coinfections Noninfluenza pathogens from most to least common were rhinovirus enterovirus coronavirus human metapneumovirus and RSV respectively Broad differences in disease prevalence and pathogen distributions were observed across geographic regions the site with the highest detection rate for both mono and coinfections demonstrated the greatest pathogen diversity A variety of respiratory pathogens and geographic variations in disease prevalence and copathogen type were observed Further research is required to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings especially considering the SARS CoV 2 pandemic and related questions regarding SARS CoV 2 disease severity and the presence of co infections

Enteroviruses including Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 are pervasive pathogens that cause significant disease including cardiomyopathies Unfortunately no treatments or vaccines are available for infected individuals We identified the host polyamine pathway as a potential drug target as inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis significantly reduces enterovirus replication in vitro and in vivo Here we show that CVB3 is sensitive to polyamine depletion through the polyamine analog diethylnorspermidine DENSpm which enhances polyamine catabolism through induction of polyamine acetylation We demonstrate that CVB3 acquires resistance to DENSpm via mutation of the 2A protease which enhances proteolytic activity in the presence of DENSpm Resistance to DENSpm occurred via mutation of a non catalytic site mutation and results in decreased fitness These data demonstrate that potential for targeting polyamine catabolism as an antiviral target as well as highlight a potential mechanism of resistance

Chronic stimulation by infectious pathogens or self antigen glucosylsphingosine GlcSph can lead to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance MGUS and multiple myeloma MM Novel assays such as the multiplex infectious antigen microarray MIAA and GlcSph assays permit identification of targets for 60 purified monoclonal immunoglobulins Igs Searching for additional targets we selected 28 purified monoclonal Igs whose antigen was not represented on the MIAA and GlcSph assays their specificity of recognition was then analyzed using microarrays consisting of 3760 B cell epitopes from 196 pathogens The peptide sequences PALTAVETG and PALTAAETG of the VP1 coat proteins of human poliovirus 1 3 and coxsackievirus B1 B3 respectively were specifically recognized by 6 28 monoclonal Igs Re analysis of patient cohorts showed that purified monoclonal Igs from 10 155 MGUS SM 6 5 and 3 147 MM 2 0 bound to the PALTAVETG or PALTAAETG epitopes Altogether PALTAV AETG initiated MGUS are not rare and few seem to evolve toward myeloma

This report is an overview of enterovirus EV detection in Tunisian polio suspected paralytic cases acute flaccid paralysis AFP cases healthy contacts and patients with primary immunodeficiencies PID during an 11 year period A total of 2735 clinical samples were analyzed for EV isolation and type identification according to the recommended protocols of the World Health Organization Three poliovirus PV serotypes and 28 different nonpolio enteroviruses NPEVs were detected The NPEV detection rate was 4 3 2 8 and 12 4 in AFP cases healthy contacts and PID patients respectively The predominant species was EV B and the circulation of viruses from species EV A was noted since 2011 All PVs detected were of Sabin origin The PV detection rate was higher in PID patients compared to AFP cases and contacts 6 8 1 5 and 1 3 respectively PV2 was not detected since 2015 Using nucleotide sequencing of the entire VP1 region 61 strains were characterized as Sabin like Among them six strains of types 1 and 3 PV were identified as pre vaccine derived polioviruses VDPVs Five type 2 PV four strains belonging to type 1 PV and two strains belonging to type 3 PV were classified as iVDPVs The data presented provide a comprehensive picture of EVs circulating in Tunisia over an 11 year period reveal changes in their epidemiology as compared to previous studies and highlight the need to set up a warning system to avoid unnoticed PVs

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of central nervous system CNS infections is important and laboratory tests help diagnose CNS infections Even when the patient has symptoms laboratory tests often do not reveal any specific findings The potential of vitamin D binding protein VDBP to be used as a biomarker for viral and bacterial CNS infections was studied

Human Enteroviruses hEVs are responsible for a wide variety of human diseases During hEVs infection virions are excreted in human feces and the fecal oral route is the primary pathway for person to person transmission Sewage surveillance could help in monitoring hEVs circulation and describing their diversity in a specific population In this study sewage samples collected in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area Argentina were retrospectively studied through an amplicon deep sequencing approach and phylogenetic analyses to characterize hEVs spread We identified 17 different hEVs types belonging to A B and C species To the best of our knowledge this is the first report in Buenos Aires for 7 identified hEV C types Phylogenetic analyses suggest several introductions of coxsackievirus B4 echovirus 1 and echovirus 9 in the country along with the national spread reached by some variants Besides well supported monophyletic groups of Argentine Uruguayan and Brazilian strains unveiled regional circulation patterns for some variants These results extend our knowledge about hEVs circulation in Buenos Aires and might exhort authorities to implement more active sewage surveillance in the region

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 inactivated vaccines have been widely inoculated among children in Kunming City after it was approved However there was a large scale outbreak of Enteroviruses EVs infection in Kunming 2018 The epidemiological characteristics of HFMD and EVs were analysed during 2008 2018 which are before and three years after EV A71 vaccine starting to use The changes in infection spectrum were also investigated especially for severe HFMD in 2018 The incidence of EV A71 decreased dramatically after the EV A71 vaccine starting use The proportion of non CV A16 EV A71 EVs positive patients raised to 77 17 85 82 while EV A71 and CV A16 only accounted for 3 41 7 24 and 6 94 19 42 in 2017 and 2018 respectively CV A6 was the most important causative agent in all clinical symptoms severe HFMD HFMD Herpangina and fever accounting from 42 13 to 62 33 EV A71 only account for 0 36 2 05 In severe HFMD CV A6 62 33 CV A10 11 64 and CV A16 10 96 were the major causative agent in 2018 EV A71 inactivated vaccine has a good protective effect against EV A71 and induced EVs infection spectrum changefully EV A71 vaccine has no or insignificant cross protection effect on CV A6 CV A10 and CV A16 Herein developing 4 valent combined vaccines is urgently needed

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a common infectious disease in western Asia area and the full range of the long term sequelae of HFMD remains poorly described We conducted a retrospective hospital based cohort study of HFMD patients with central nervous system CNS complications caused by EV A71 or CV A16 between 2010 and 2016 Patients were classified into three groups including CNS only autonomic nervous system ANS dysregulation and cardiorespiratory failure Neurologic examination neurodevelopmental assessments Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI and lung function were performed at follow up Of the 176 patients followed up 24 suffered CNS only 133 ANS dysregulation and 19 cardiorespiratory failure Median follow up period was 4 3 years range 1 4 8 3 The rate of neurological abnormalities was 25 43 of 171 at discharge and 10 17 of 171 at follow up The rates of poor outcome were significantly different between the three groups of complications in motor 28 38 71 domain p 0 020 but not for cognitive 20 24 35 language 25 36 41 and adaptive 24 16 26 domains

Enterovirus 71 EV71 can cause a severe hand foot mouth disease in children However the precise mechanism of EV71 associated disease particularly the neuropathogenesis and pulmonary disorder is still not fully understood because no suitable animal models are available The human scavenger receptor class B member 2 hSCARB2 is a cellular receptor for EV71 Here we generated a novel knock in KI mouse model using the CRISPR Cas9 system to insert the hSCARB2 gene into the mouse

Acute respiratory infections ARI are associated with a huge morbidity and mortality worldwide Rhinoviruses RVs and Enteroviruses EVs are recognized as leading causes of ARI

Coxsackievirus A6 CV A6 has been emerging as a major pathogen of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD Study on the pathogenesis of CV A6 infection and development of vaccines is hindered by a lack of appropriate animal models Here we report an actively immunized challenged mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of a Vero cell based inactivated CV A6 vaccine candidate The neonatal Kunming mice were inoculated with a purified formaldehyde inactivated CV A6 vaccine on days 3 and 9 followed by challenging on day 14 with a naturally selected virulent strain at a lethal dose Within 14 days postchallenge all mice in the immunized groups survived while 100 of the Alum only inoculated mice died Neutralizing antibodies NtAbs were detected in the serum of immunized suckling mice and the NtAb levels correlated with the survival rate of the challenged mice The virus loads in organs were reduced and pathological changes and viral protein expression were weak in the immunized mice compared with those in Alum only inoculated control mice Elevated levels of interleukin 4 6 interferon γ and tumour necrosis factor α were also observed in Alum only control mice compared with immunized mice Importantly the virulent CV A6 challenge strain was selected quickly and conveniently from a RD cell virus stock characterized with the natural multi genotypes The virulent determinants were mapped to V124M and I242 V at VP1 Together our results indicated that this actively immunized mouse model is invaluable for future studies to develop multivalent vaccines containing the major component of CV A6 against HFMD

To date only a handful of duplicated genes have been described in RNA viruses This shortage can be attributed to different factors including the RNA viruses with high mutation rate that would make a large genome more prone to acquire deleterious mutations This may explain why sequence based approaches have only found duplications in their most recent evolutionary history To detect earlier duplications we performed protein tertiary structure comparisons for every RNA virus family represented in the Protein Data Bank We present a list of thirty pairs of possible paralogs with 30 per cent sequence identity It is argued that these pairs are the outcome of six duplication events These include the α and β subunits of the fungal toxin KP6 present in the dsRNA

A national surveillance system on hand foot and mouth disease HFMD was launched in 2008 in China Since then millions of HFMD cases have been reported each year with enterovirus A71 EV A71 coxsackievirus A16 CV A16 and coxsackievirus A6 CV A6 as the major causative pathogens Long term surveillance of viral infection rates and genetic changes is essential for understanding the disease epidemiology pattern Here we analyzed molecular surveillance data on CV A16 covering a period of 12 years 2008 2019 in Guangdong China one of the regions reporting the largest number of HFMD cases Full VP1 sequences of 456 strains were determined to examine the genetic diversity and changes in the distribution of CV A16 variants Our study revealed an irregular pattern of CV A16 infections in Guangdong Different from the cyclic epidemics observed in some Asia Pacific regions there was a continuously high CV A16 infection rate from 2008 to 2014 and after a period of lower epidemic activity in 2015 2017 an upsurge of CV A16 infection was observed in 2018 2019 Cocirculation of subgenotypes B1a and B1b was observed but while subgenotype B1a was predominant from 2008 to 2012 it appears to have been replaced by B1b which has circulated as the predominant subgenotype since 2013 Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the circulating CV A16 strains are endemic with occasional transmission between neighboring regions The re emergence of B1a in 2016 2019 in Guangdong was likely the result of introduction s from Southeast Asia These results highlight the importance of continuous molecular surveillance from different areas which will improve our understanding of the origin of the epidemic and facilitate the development of strategies for HFMD disease control

Enterovirus71 EV71 the major cause of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD has increasingly become a public health challenge Type I interferons IFNs can regulate innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens MicroRNAs miRNAs play regulatory roles in host innate immune responses to viral infections However the roles of miR 103 and miR 107 in EV71 infection remain unclear

The aim of our study was to define the spectrum of viral infections in pilgrims with acute respiratory tract illnesses presenting to healthcare facilities around the holy places in Makkah Saudi Arabia during the 2019 Hajj pilgrimage During the five days of Hajj a total of 185 pilgrims were enrolled in the study Nasopharyngeal swabs NPSs of 126 185 patients 68 11 tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses by PCR Among the 126 pilgrims whose NPS were PCR positive a there were 93 126 74 with a single virus infection b 33 126 26 with coinfection with more than one virus up to four viruses of these 25 33 cases had coinfection with two viruses 6 33 were infected with three viruses while the remaining 2 33 patients had infection with four viruses Human rhinovirus HRV was the most common detected viruses with 53 cases 42 06 followed by 27 21 43 cases of influenza A H1N1 and 23 18 25 cases of influenza A other than H1N1 Twenty five cases of CoV 229E 19 84 were detected more than other coronavirus members 5 CoV OC43 3 97 4 CoV HKU1 3 17 and 1 CoV NL63 0 79 PIV 3 was detected in 8 cases 6 35 A single case 0 79 of PIV 1 and PIV 4 were found HMPV represented 5 3 97 RSV and influenza B 4 3 17 for each and Parechovirus 1 0 79 Enterovirus Bocavirus and

Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor CAR is present in epithelial and vascular endothelial cell junctions We have previously shown a hemorrhagic phenotype in germ line CAR knock out mouse embryos we have also found that CAR interacts with ZO 1 and β catenin However the role of CAR in vascular endothelial junction permeability has not been proven To understand the roles of CAR in the vascular endothelial junctions we generated endothelium specific CAR knockout CAR eKO mice In the absence of CAR the endothelial cell layer showed an increase in transmembrane electrical resistance TER Ω and coxsackievirus permeability Evans blue dye and 70 kDa dextran FITC were delivered by tail vein injection We observed increased vascular permeability in the hearts of adult CAR eKO mice compare with wild type WT mice There was a marked increase in monocyte and macrophage penetration into the peritoneal cavity caused by thioglycolate induced peritonitis We found that CAR ablation in endothelial cells was not significantly increased coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 induced myocarditis in murine model However tissue virus titers were significantly higher in CAR eKO mice compared with WT Moreover CVB3 was detected in the brain of CAR eKO mice Endothelial CAR deletion affects the expression of major endothelial junction proteins such as cadherin and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 PECAM 1 in the cultured endothelial cells as well as liver vessel We suggest that CAR expression is required for normal vascular permeability and endothelial tight junction homeostasis Furthermore CVB3 organ penetration and myocarditis severities were dependent on the endothelial CAR level

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 and coxsackievirus A16 CA16 are major etiological agents of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in children which may result in fatal neurological complications The development of safe cost effective vaccines against HFMD especially for use in developing countries is still a top public health priority We have successfully generated a stable cold adapted temperature sensitive conditional lethal EV A71 through adaptive culturing in Vero cells at incrementally lower cultivation temperatures An additional 40 passages at an incubation temperature of 28 C and a temperature reversion study at an incubation temperature of 37 C and 39 5 C reveals the virus s phenotypic and genetic stability at the predefined culture conditions Six unique mutations two in noncoding regions and four in nonstructural protein coding genes in combination may have contributed to its stable phenotype and inability to fully revert to its original wild phenotype The safety and immunogenicity of this stable cold adapted temperature sensitive conditional lethal EV A71 was performed in six monkeys None of the inoculated monkeys developed any obvious clinical illness except one which developed a transient spike of fever No gross postmortem lesion or abnormal histological finding was noted for all monkeys at autopsy No virus was reisolated although EV A71 specific RNA was detected in serum samples collected on both day 4 and day 8 postinoculation Only EV A71 RNA and viral antigen were detected in the spleen homogenate and peripheral blood mononuclear cells respectively collected on day 4 The two remaining monkeys developed good humoral immune response on day 14 and day 30 post inoculation

Enteric viruses such as poliovirus are a leading cause of gastroenteritis which causes 2 3 million deaths annually Environmental surveillance of wastewater supplements clinical surveillance for monitoring enteric virus circulation However while many environmental surveillance methods require liquid samples some at risk locations utilize pit latrines with waste characterized by high solids content This study s objective was to develop and evaluate enteric virus concentration protocols for high solids content samples Two existing protocols were modified and tested using poliovirus type 1 PV1 seeded into primary sludge Method 1 M1 utilized acid adsorption followed by 2 or 3 elutions glycine sodium chloride and or threonine sodium chloride and skimmed milk flocculation Method 2 M2 began with centrifugation The liquid fraction was filtered through a ViroCap filter and eluted beef extract glycine The solid fraction was eluted beef extract disodium hydrogen phosphate citric acid and concentrated by skimmed milk flocculation Recovery was enumerated by plaque assay M1 yielded higher PV1 recovery than M2 though this result was not statistically significant 26 1 and 15 9 respectively M1 was further optimized resulting in significantly greater PV1 recovery when compared to the original protocol

Meningitis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality particularly in the first three months of life

Coxsackievirus A24 variant CVA24v the main causative agent of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis AHC can be isolated from both the eyes and lower alimentary tract However the molecular features of CVA24v in feces is not well documented In this study we compared the VP1 and 3C sequences of CVA24v strains isolated from feces during AHC epidemics in Cuba in 1997 2003 and 2008 2009 with those obtained from conjunctival swabs during the same epidemic period The sequence analyses of the 3C and VP1 region of stool isolates from the three epidemics showed a high degree of nucleotide identity ranging from 97 3 100 to the corresponding conjunctival isolates The phylogenetic analysis showed that fecal CVA24v isolates from the 1997 and 2003 Cuban outbreaks formed a clade with CVA24v strains isolated from conjunctival swabs in Cuba and other countries during the same period There were three amino acid changes 3C region and one amino acid change VP1 region in seven CVA24v strains isolated sequentially over 20 days from fecal samples of one patient suggesting viral replication in the intestine Despite these substitutions the virus from the conjunctival swab and fecal samples were genetically very similar Therefore fecal samples should be considered as a reliable alternative sample type for the routine molecular diagnosis and molecular epidemiology of CVA24v also during outbreaks of AHC

Physical distancing and facemask use are worldwide recognized as effective non pharmaceutical interventions NPIs against the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 Since January 2020 Taiwan has introduced both NPIs but their effectiveness on non COVID 19 respiratory viruses NCRVs remain underexplored

With the arrival of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 in Brazil in February 2020 several preventive measures were taken by the population aiming to avoid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 infection including the use of masks social distancing and frequent hand washing then these measures may have contributed to preventing infection also by other respiratory viruses Our goal was to determine the frequencies of Influenza A and B viruses FLUAV FLUBV human mastadenovirus C HAdV C Enterovirus 68 EV 68 and rhinovirus RV besides SARS CoV 2 among hospitalized patients suspect of COVID 19 with cases of acute respiratory disease syndrome ARDS in the period of March to December 2020 and to detect possible coinfections among them Nucleic acid detection was performed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction RT qPCR in respiratory samples using naso oropharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage A total of 418 samples of the 987 analyzed 42 3 were positive for SARS CoV 2 16 1 62 samples were positive for FLUAV no sample was positive for FLUBV or EV 68 67 6 78 samples were positive for HAdV C 55 samples were positive for RV 1 2 26 3 and 37 for RV 2 2 13 6 Coinfections were also detected including a triple coinfection with SARS CoV 2 FLUAV and HAdV C In the present work a very low frequency of FLUV was reported among hospitalized patients with ARDS compared to the past years probably due to preventive measures taken to avoid COVID 19 and the high influenza vaccination coverage in the region in which this study was performed

The switch from using only trivalent oral polio vaccine tOPV to sequential schedules combining inactivated poliovirus vaccine IPV and bivalent oral polio vaccine bOPV for polio vaccination will cause changes to mucosal immunity against polio in infants which plays an important role in preventing the poliovirus spread Here we analyzed mucosal immunity against poliovirus in the intestine during different sequential vaccination schedules We conducted clinical trials in Guangxi Province China on 1 200 2 month old infants who were randomly assigned to one of three vaccination schedule groups IPV bOPV bOPV IPV IPV tOPV and IPV IPV bOPV with vaccine doses administered at 8 12 and 16 weeks of age Stool samples were collected from 10 of participants in each group before administration of the second vaccine doses and at 1 2 and 4 weeks after the administrations of the second and third vaccine doses Immunoglobulin A IgA in the stool samples was measured to analyze the mucosal immune response in the intestine Because of the absence of poliovirus type 2 in bOPV the vaccination schedule of IPV IPV bOPV did not sufficiently raise intestinal mucosal immunity against poliovirus type 2 although some cross immunity was seen The level of intestinal mucosal immunity was related to shedding status shedders could produce intestinal mucosa IgA more quickly The intestinal mucosal immunity level was not related to serum neutralizing antibody level In the combined sequential vaccination schedule of IPV and bOPV the risk of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 cVDPV2 may be increased owing to insufficient intestinal mucosal immunity against poliovirus type 2

Unprecedented 3D hexa adducts of 60 fullerene peripherally decorated with twelve tryptophan Trp or tyrosine Tyr residues have been synthesized Studies on the antiviral activity of these novel compounds against HIV and EV71 reveal that they are much more potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the previously described dendrimer prototypes AL 385 and AL 463 which possess the same number of Trp Tyr residues on the periphery but attached to a smaller and more flexible pentaerythritol core These results demonstrate the relevance of the globular 3D presentation of the peripheral groups Trp Tyr as well as the length of the spacer connecting them to the central core to interact with the viral envelopes particularly in the case of HIV and support the hypothesis that 60 fullerene can be an alternative and attractive biocompatible carbon based scaffold for this type of highly symmetrical dendrimers In addition the functionalized fullerenes here described which display twelve peripheral negatively charged indole moieties on their globular surface define a new and versatile class of compounds with a promising potential in biomedical applications

As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 pandemic continues to spread several variants have emerged Variants B 1 1 7 and B 1 351 have attracted significant attention owing to their widespread transmission and possible immune evasion A total of 19 SARS CoV 2 vaccines based on original strains have entered clinical studies including nine vaccines that have obtained emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations However newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy Decreased efficacy of the Novartis Johnson Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines against B 1 351 has been reported The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS CoV 2 pandemic via vaccination Several response strategies including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses and accelerating next generation vaccines against variants have been suggested

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 has been associated with severe neurological forms of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD EV A71 infects motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions NMJs to invade the central nervous system CNS Here we investigate the role of peripherin PRPH during EV A71 infection a type III intermediate neurofilament involved in neurodegenerative conditions In mice infected with EV A71 PRPH co localizes with viral particles in the muscles at NMJs and in the spinal cord In motor neuron like and neuroblastoma cell lines surface expressed PRPH facilitates viral entry while intracellular PRPH influences viral genome replication through interactions with structural and non structural viral components Importantly PRPH does not play a role during infection with coxsackievirus A16 another causative agent of HFMD rarely associated with neurological complications suggesting that EV A71 ability to exploit PRPH represents a unique attribute for successful CNS invasion Finally we show that EV A71 also exploits some of the many PRPH interacting partners Of these small GTP binding protein Rac1 represents a potential druggable host target to limit neuroinvasion of EV A71

Coxsackievirus A16 CA16 is one of the neurotropic pathogen that has been associated with severe neurological forms of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD but its pathogenesis is not yet clear The limited host range of CA16 make the establishment of a suitable animal model that can recapitulate the neurological pathology observed in human HFMD more difficult Because the human scavenger receptor class B member 2 hSCARB2 is a cellular receptor for CA16 we used transgenic mice bearing human SCARB2 and nasally infected them with CA16 to study the pathogenicity of the virus

Sterile alpha motif and histidine aspartic acid domain containing protein 1 SAMHD1 possesses multiple biological activities such as virus restriction innate immunity regulation and autoimmunity Our previous study demonstrated that SAMHD1 potently inhibits the replication of enterovirus 71 EV71 In this study we observed that SAMHD1 also restricts multiple enteroviruses EVs including coxsackievirus A16 CA16 and enterovirus D68 EVD68 but not coxsackievirus A6 CA6 Mechanistically SAMHD1 competitively interacted with the same domain in VP1 that binds to VP2 of EV71 and EVD68 thereby interfering with the interaction between VP1 and VP2 and therefore viral assembly Moreover we showed that the SAMHD1 T592A mutant maintained the EV71 inhibitory effect by attenuating the interaction between VP1 and VP2 whereas the T592D mutant failed to We also demonstrated that SAMHD1 could not inhibit CA6 because a different binding site is required for the SAMHD1 and VP1 interaction Our findings reveal the mechanism of SAMHD1 inhibition of multiple EVs and this could potentially be important for developing drugs against a broad range of EVs

Enterovirus A 71 EV71 is a global highly contagkkious pathogen responsible for severe cases of hand food mouth disease HFMD The use of vaccines eliciting cross neutralizing antibodies NTAbs against the different circulating EV71 sub genotypes is important for preventing HFMD outbreaks Here we tested the cross neutralizing activities induced by EV71 genotype sub genotype A B0 B4 C1 C2 C4 and C5 viruses using rats Differences were noted in the cross neutralization of the 10 sub genotypes tested but there were generally good levels of cross neutralization except against genotype A virus against which neutralization antibody titres NTAb where the lowest with NTAbs being the highest against sub genotype B4 Moreover NTAb responses induced by C4 B4 C1 and C2 viruses were homogenous with values of maximum minimum NTAb ratios MAX MIN against all B and C viruses ranging between 4 0 and 6 0 whereas MAX MIN values against B3 and A viruses were highly variable 48 0 and 256 0 respectively We then dissected the cross neutralizing ability of sera from infants and children and rats immunized with C4 EV71 vaccines Cross neutralizing titers against the 10 sub genotypes were good in both vaccinated infants and children and rats with the MAX MIN ranging from 1 8 3 4 and 5 1 7 1 respectively which were similar to those found in naturally infected patients 2 8 Therefore we conclude that C4 EV71 vaccines can provide global protection to infants and children against HFMD caused by different sub genotypes

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a mild illness caused by enteroviruses EV although in some Asian countries large outbreaks have been reported in the last 25 years with a considerable incidence of neurological complications This study describes epidemiological and clinical characteristics of EV infections involved in HFMD and other mucocutaneous symptoms from 2006 to 2020 in Spain EV positive samples from 368 patients were included EV species A were identified in 85 1 of those typed EV Coxsackievirus CV A6 was the prevalent serotype 60 9 followed by EV A71 9 9 and CVA16 7 7 Infections affected children 1 6 years old mainly and show seasonality with peaks in spring summer and autumn Clinical data indicated few cases of atypical HFMD as well as those with neurological complications associated with the 2016 EV A71 outbreak Phylogenetic analysis of CVA6 VP1 sequences showed different sub clusters circulating from 2010 to present In conclusion HFMD or exanthemas case reporting has increased in Spain in recent years probably associated with an increase in circulation of CVA6 although they did not seem to show greater severity However EV surveillance in mucocutaneous manifestations should be improved to identify the emergence of new types or variants causing outbreaks and more severe pathologies

Viral infections are the leading cause of childhood acute febrile illnesses motivating consultation in sub Saharan Africa The majority of causal viruses are never identified in low resource clinical settings as such testing is either not part of routine screening or available diagnostic tools have limited ability to detect new unexpected viral variants An in depth exploration of the blood virome is therefore necessary to clarify the potential viral origin of fever in children Metagenomic next generation sequencing is a powerful tool for such broad investigations allowing the detection of RNA and DNA viral genomes Here we describe the blood virome of 816 febrile children 5 years presenting at outpatient departments in Dar es Salaam over one year We show that half of the patients 394 816 had at least one detected virus recognized as causes of human infection disease 13 8 enteroviruses enterovirus A B C and rhinovirus A and C 12 rotaviruses 11 human herpesvirus type 6 Additionally we report the detection of a large number of viruses related to arthropod vertebrate or mammalian viral species not yet known to cause human infection disease highlighting those who should be on the radar deserve specific attention in the febrile paediatric population and more broadly for surveillance of emerging pathogens

Although most enterovirus EV infections can be asymptomatic these viral agents can cause serious conditions associated with central nervous system respiratory disease and uncommon manifestations of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD EV coinfections have been rarely reported with development of complications and severe clinical outcome An atypical case of a child presenting HFMD and severe acute respiratory syndrome co infected with EV D68 and CVA6 is reported herein

Viruses experience selective pressure on the timing and order of events during infection to maximize the number of viable offspring they produce Additionally they may experience variability in cellular environments encountered as individual eukaryotic cells can display variation in gene expression among cells This leads to a dynamic phenotypic landscape that viruses must face to replicate To examine replication dynamics displayed by viruses faced with this variable landscape we have developed a method for fitting a stochastic mechanistic model of viral infection to time lapse imaging data from high throughput single cell poliovirus infection experiments The model s mechanistic parameters provide estimates of several aspects associated with the virus s intracellular dynamics We examine distributions of parameter estimates and assess their variability to gain insight into the root causes of variability in viral growth dynamics We also fit our model to experiments performed under various drug treatments and examine which parameters differ under these conditions We find that parameters associated with translation and early stage viral replication processes are essential for the model to capture experimentally observed dynamics In aggregate our results suggest that differences in viral growth data generated under different treatments can largely be captured by steps that occur early in the replication process

Encephalitis and meningitis EM are severe infections of the central nervous system associated with high morbidity and mortality The etiology of EM in Kazakhstan is not clearly defined so from February 1 2017 to January 31 2018 we conducted hospital based syndromic surveillance for EM at the Shymkent City Hospital in the South Kazakhstan region All consenting inpatients meeting a standard case definition were enrolled Blood and cerebrospinal fluid CSF samples were collected for bacterial culture and CSF samples were additionally tested by PCR for four bacterial species and three viruses using a cascading algorithm We enrolled 556 patients Of these 494 were of viral etiology including 4 probable rabies cases 37 were of bacterial etiology 19 were of unknown etiology and 6 were not tested The most commonly identified pathogens included enterovirus 73 n 406 cases herpes simplex virus 12 8 n 71 and Neisseria meningitidis 3 8 n 21 The incidence rates IRs for enteroviral and meningococcal EM were found to be 14 5 and 0 7 per 100 000 persons respectively The IR for bacterial EM using both PCR and culture results was 3 5 times higher compared to culture only results Antibacterial medicines were used to treat 97 2 480 494 of virus associated EM Incorporation of PCR into routine laboratory diagnostics of EM improves diagnosis pathogen identification ensures IRs are not underestimated and can help avoid unnecessary antibacterial treatment

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AECOPD that require hospitalization and emergency department visits are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality Respiratory viral infection is an important cause of severe AECOPD We evaluated the incidence and prognostic factors of viral infection in severe AECOPD

Enterovirus 71 EV71 has caused large hand foot and mouth disease HFMD epidemics among young children and EV71 infection is the leading cause of severe HFMD cases and deaths In mainland China the prevalence and risk factors of non C4 EV71 strains are still unclear In this study we monitored non C4 strains over a 10 year HFMD epidemiological surveillance period in Xiamen The 5 UTR and VP1 coding region of EV71 strains were amplified by RT nested PCR and sequenced Thirty two non C4 EV71 strains were identified during 2009 2018 This study provides important information about the prevalence of EV71 in China that will be applicable for development of vaccines and diagnostic reagents as well as establishment of policies for HFMD prevention and control

In 2018 an upsurge in echovirus 30 E30 infections was reported in Europe We conducted a large scale epidemiologic and evolutionary study of 1 329 E30 strains collected in 22 countries in Europe during 2016 2018 Most E30 cases affected persons 0 4 years of age 29 and 25 34 years of age 27 Sequences were divided into 6 genetic clades G1 G6 Most 53 sequences belonged to G1 followed by G6 23 G2 17 G4 4 G3 0 3 and G5 0 2 Each clade encompassed unique individual recombinant forms G1 and G4 displayed 2 unique recombinant forms Rapid turnover of new clades and recombinant forms occurred over time Clades G1 and G6 dominated in 2018 suggesting the E30 upsurge was caused by emergence of 2 distinct clades circulating in Europe Investigation into the mechanisms behind the rapid turnover of E30 is crucial for clarifying the epidemiology and evolution of these enterovirus infections

The emergence and re emergence of RNA virus outbreaks highlight the urgent need for the development of broad spectrum antivirals Polyamines are positively charged small molecules required for the infectivity of a wide range of RNA viruses therefore may become good antiviral targets Cucurbit 7 uril CB 7 a synthetic macrocyclic molecule which can bind with amine based organic compounds with high affinity has been shown to regulate bioactive molecules through competitive binding In this study we tested the antiviral activity of CB 7 against diverse RNA viruses including a panel of enteroviruses i e human enterovirus A71 coxsackievirus A16 coxsackievirus B3 and echovirus 11 some flaviviruses i e dengue virus and Zika virus and an alphavirus representative Semliki forest virus CB 7 can inhibit virus replications in a variety of cell lines and its mechanism of action is through the competitive binding with polyamines Our findings not only for the first time provide evidence that CB 7 can be a promising broad spectrum antiviral agent but more importantly offer a novel therapeutic strategy to fight against RNA viruses by supramolecular sequestration of polyamines

Outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses cVDPVs pose a threat to the eventual eradication of all polioviruses In 2017 an outbreak of cVDPV type 2 cVDPV2 occurred in the midst of a war in Syria We describe vaccination based risk factors for and the successful response to the outbreak

Enteroviruses are associated with various diseases accompanied by rare but severe complications In recent years outbreaks of enterovirus D68 and enterovirus A71 associated with severe respiratory infections and neurological complications have been reported worldwide Since information on molecular epidemiology in respiratory samples is still limited the genetic diversity of enteroviruses was retrospectively analysed over a 4 year period 2013 2016 in respiratory samples from paediatric patients Partial viral major capsid protein gene VP1 sequences were determined for genotyping Enteroviruses were detected in 255 6 1 of 4187 specimens Phylogenetic analyses of 233 91 4 strains revealed 25 different genotypes distributed to

Murine models of coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 induced myocarditis well represent the different outcomes of this inflammatory heart disease Previously we found that CVB3 infected A BY SnJ mice susceptible for severe acute and chronic myocarditis have lower natural killer NK cell levels than C57BL 6 mice with mild acute myocarditis There is evidence that myeloid derived suppressor cells MDSC may inhibit NK cells influencing the course of myocarditis To investigate the MDSC NK interrelationship in acute myocarditis we used CVB3 infected A BY SnJ mice Compared to non infected mice we found increased cell numbers of MDSC in the spleen and heart of CVB3 infected A BY SnJ mice In parallel S100A8 and S100A9 were increased in the heart spleen and especially in splenic MDSC cells compared to non infected mice In vitro experiments provided evidence that MDSC disrupt cytotoxic NK cell function upon co culturing with MDSC MDSC specific depletion by an anti Ly6G antibody led to a significant reduction in the virus load and injury in hearts of infected animals The decreased cardiac damage in MDSC depleted mice was associated with fewer Mac3

The identification of CSF biomarkers for bacterial meningitis can potentially improve diagnosis and understanding of pathogenesis and the differentiation from viral CNS infections is of particular clinical importance Considering that substantial changes in CSF metabolites in CNS infections have recently been demonstrated we compared concentrations of 188 metabolites in CSF samples from patients with bacterial meningitis

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a contagious childhood illness and annually affects millions of children aged less than 5 years across the Asia Pacific region HFMD transmission mainly occurs through direct contact person to person and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces and objects Therefore public health measures to reduce the spread of HFMD in kindergartens and daycare centers are essential Based on the guidelines by the Department of Disease Control a school closure policy for HFMD outbreaks wherein every school in Thailand must close when several HFMD classrooms more than two cases in each classroom are encountered within a week was implemented although without strong supporting evidence We therefore conducted a prospective cohort study of children attending five kindergartens during 2019 and 2020 We used molecular genetic techniques to investigate the characteristics of the spreading patterns of HFMD in a school based setting in Bangkok Thailand These analyses identified 22 index cases of HFMD symptomatic infections and 25 cases of enterovirus positive asymptomatic contacts 24 students and one teacher Enterovirus EV A71 was the most common enterovirus detected and most of the infected persons 8 12 developed symptoms Other enteroviruses included coxsackieviruses CVs A4 CV A6 CV A9 and CV A10 as well as echovirus The pattern of the spread of HFMD showed that 45 of the subsequent enteroviruses detected in each outbreak possessed the same serotype as the first index case Moreover we found a phylogenetic relationship among enteroviruses detected among contact and index cases in the same kindergarten These findings confirm the benefit of molecular genetic assays to acquire accurate data to support school closure policies designed to control HFMD infections

Highly pathogenic virus infections usually trigger cytokine storms which may have adverse effects on vital organs and result in high mortalities The two cytokines interleukin IL 4 and interferon IFN γ play key roles in the generation and regulation of cytokine storms However it is still unclear whether the cytokine with the largest induction amplitude is the same under different virus infections It is unknown which is the most critical and whether there are any mathematical formulas that can fit the changing rules of cytokines Three coronaviruses SARS CoV MERS CoV and SARS CoV 2 three influenza viruses 2009H1N1 H5N1 and H7N9 Ebola virus human immunodeficiency virus dengue virus Zika virus West Nile virus hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus and enterovirus 71 were included in this analysis We retrieved the cytokine fold change FC viral load and clearance rate data from these highly pathogenic virus infections in humans and analyzed the correlations among them Our analysis showed that interferon inducible protein IP 10 IL 6 IL 8 and IL 17 are the most common cytokines with the largest induction amplitudes Equations were obtained the maximum induced cytokine max FC IFN γ FC IFN γ FC IL 4 FC if IFN γ FC IL 4 FC 1 max FC IL 4 FC if IFN γ FC IL 4 FC 1 For IFN γ inducible infections 1 30 log2 IFN γ FC log10 viral load 2 48 2 83 clearance rate The clinical relevance of cytokines and their antagonists is also discussed

Minimizing the spread of viruses in the environment is the first defence line when fighting outbreaks and pandemics but the current COVID 19 pandemic demonstrates how difficult this is on a global scale particularly in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way Here we introduce and develop a sustainable and biodegradable antiviral filtration membrane composed of amyloid nanofibrils made from food grade milk proteins and iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles synthesized in situ from iron salts by simple pH tuning Thus all the membrane components are made of environmentally friendly non toxic and widely available materials The membrane has outstanding efficacy against a broad range of viruses which include enveloped non enveloped airborne and waterborne viruses such as SARS CoV 2 H1N1 the influenza A virus strain responsible for the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and enterovirus 71 a non enveloped virus resistant to harsh conditions such as highly acidic pH which highlights a possible role in fighting the current and future viral outbreaks and pandemics

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 can cause hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in children and may be associated with severe neurological complications There have been numerous reports of increased incidence of EV A71 subgenogroup C1 EV A71 C1 infections associated with neurological diseases since the first occurrence in Germany in 2015 Here we describe 11 full length genome sequences of 2019 EV A71 C1 strains isolated from HFMD patients in Thailand from 2019 to early 2020 The genetic evolution of 2019 EV A71 C1 was traced in the outbreaks and the emergence of multiple lineages was detected Our results demonstrated that 2019 EV A71 C1 from Thailand emerged through recombination between its nonstructural protein gene and those of other EV A genotypes Bayesian based phylogenetic analysis showed that the 2019 EV A71 C1 Thai strains share a common ancestor with variants in Europe Denmark and France The substitution rate for the 2019 EV A71 C1 genome was estimated to be 4 38 10

Enteroviruses EVs 3C proteins suppress type I interferon IFN responses mediated by retinoid acid inducible gene I RIG I while an E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 25 TRIM25 mediated RIG I ubiquitination is essential for RIG I antiviral activity Therefore whether the effect of EVs 3C on RIG I is associated with TRIM25 expression is worth to be further investigated Here we demonstrate that 3C proteins of EV71 and coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 reduced not only RIG I expression but also TRIM25 expression through protease cleavage activity while overexpression of TRIM25 restored RIG I expression and IFN β production reduced by 3C proteins Further investigation confirmed that the two amino acids and functional domains in TRIM25 required for RIG I ubiquitination and TRIM25 structural conformation were essential for the recovery of RIG I expression Moreover we also observed that TRIM25 could rescue RIG I expression reduced by 3C proteins of CVA6 and EV D68 but not CVA16 Our findings provide an insightful interpretation of 3C mediated host innate immune suppression and support TRIM25 as an attractive target against multiple EVs infection

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 has been implicated in outbreaks of severe respiratory illness and is associated with acute flaccid myelitis AFM EV D68 is often detected in patient respiratory samples but has also been detected in stool and wastewater suggesting the potential for both respiratory and enteric routes of transmission Here we used a panel of EV D68 isolates including a historical pre 2014 isolate and multiple contemporary isolates from AFM outbreak years to define the dynamics of viral replication and the host response to infection in primary human airway cells and stem cell derived enteroids We show that some recent EV D68 isolates have decreased sensitivity to acid and temperature compared with earlier isolates and that the respiratory but not intestinal epithelium induces a robust type III interferon response that restricts infection Our findings define the differential responses of the respiratory and intestinal epithelium to contemporary EV D68 isolates and suggest that a subset of isolates have the potential to target both the human airway and gastrointestinal tracts

Similar to that of other enteroviruses the replication of enterovirus 71 EV71 occurs on rearranged membranous structures called replication organelles ROs Phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase III PI4KB which is required by enteroviruses for RO formation yields phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate PI4P on ROs PI4P then binds and induces conformational changes in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp to modulate RdRp activity Here we targeted 3D polymerase the core enzyme of EV71 ROs and found that the host factor Annexin A2 ANXA2 can interact with 3D polymerase and promote the replication of EV71 Then an experiment showed that the annexin domain of ANXA2 which possesses membrane binding capacity mediates the interaction of ANXA2 with EV71 3D polymerase Further research showed that ANXA2 is localized on ROs and interacts with PI4KB Overexpression of ANXA2 stimulated the formation of PI4P and the level of PI4P was decreased in ANXA2 knockout cells Furthermore ANXA2 PI4KB and 3D were shown to be localized to the viral RNA replication site where they form a higher order protein complex and the presence of ANXA2 promoted the PI4KB 3D interaction Altogether our data provide new insight into the role of ANXA2 in facilitating formation of the EV71 RNA replication complex

Characterizing protein protein interactions PPIs is an effective method to help explore protein function Here through integrating a newly identified split human Rhinovirus 3 C HRV 3 C protease super folder GFP sfGFP and ClpXP SsrA protein degradation machinery we developed a fluorescence assisted single cell methodology split protease E coli ClpXP SPEC to explore protein protein interactions for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species in E coli cells We firstly identified a highly efficient split HRV 3 C protease with high re assembly ability and then incorporated it into the SPEC method The SPEC method could convert the cellular protein protein interaction to quantitative fluorescence signals through a split HRV 3 C protease mediated proteolytic reaction with high efficiency and broad temperature adaptability Using SPEC method we explored the interactions among effectors of representative type I E and I F CRISPR Cas complexes which combining with subsequent studies of Cas3 mutations conferred further understanding of the functions and structures of CRISPR Cas complexes

Data on the neurodevelopment of children who experienced central nervous system CNS infections with enteroviruses EV or parechoviruses hPeV is scarce and mostly limited to follow up of short term outcomes

RNA viruses exist as genetically heterogeneous populations due to high mutation rates and many of these mutations reduce fitness and or replication speed However it is unknown whether mutations can increase replication speed of a virus already well adapted to replication in cultured cells By sequentially passaging coxsackievirus B3 in cultured cells and collecting the very earliest progeny we selected for increased replication speed We found that a single mutation in a viral capsid protein VP1 F106L was sufficient for the fast replication phenotype Characterization of this mutant revealed quicker genome release during entry compared to wild type virus highlighting a previously unappreciated infection barrier However this mutation also reduced capsid stability in vitro and reduced replication and pathogenesis in mice These results reveal a tradeoff between overall replication speed and fitness Importantly this approach selecting for the earliest viral progeny could be applied to a variety of viral systems and has the potential to reveal unanticipated inefficiencies in viral replication cycles

Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 infected individuals are at an increased risk for coinfections therefore physicians need to be cognizant about excluding other treatable respiratory pathogens Here we report coinfection with SARS CoV 2 and other respiratory pathogens in patients admitted to the coronavirus disease COVID care facilities of an Indian tertiary care hospital From June 2020 through January 2021 we tested 191 patients with SARS CoV 2 for 33 other respiratory pathogens using an fast track diagnostics respiratory pathogen 33 FTD 33 assay Additionally information regarding other relevant respiratory pathogens was collected by reviewing their laboratory data Overall 13 pathogens were identified among patients infected with SARS CoV 2 and 46 6 89 191 of patients had coinfection with one or more additional pathogens Bacterial coinfections 41 4 79 191 were frequent with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae Coinfections with SARS CoV 2 and Pneumocystis jirovecii or Legionella pneumophila were also identified The viral coinfection rate was 7 3 with human adenovirus and human rhinovirus being the most common Five patients in our cohort had positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii and K pneumoniae and two patients had active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection In total 47 1 90 191 of patients with coinfections were identified The higher proportion of patients with coinfections in our cohort supports the systemic use of antibiotics in patients with severe SARS CoV 2 pneumonia with rapid de escalation based on respiratory PCR culture results The timely and simultaneous identification of coinfections can contribute to improved health of COVID 19 patients and enhanced antibiotic stewardship during the pandemic

Several viruses have been proven to inhibit the formation of RNA processing bodies P bodies however knowledge regarding whether enterovirus blocks P body formation remains unclear and the detailed molecular mechanisms and functions of picornavirus regulation of P bodies are limited Here we show the crucial role of 2A protease in inhibiting P bodies to promote viral replication during enterovirus 71 infection Moreover we found that the activity of 2A protease is essential to inhibit P body formation which was proven by the result that infection with EV71 2A

As frequent viral outbreaks continue to pose threat to public health the unavailability of antiviral drugs and challenges associated with vaccine development underscore the need for antiviral drugs discovery in emergent moments endemic or pandemic Plants in response to microbial and pest attacks are able to produce defence molecules such as antimicrobial peptides as components of their innate immunity which can be explored for viral therapeutics

Compared to other RV species RV C has been associated with more severe respiratory illness and is more likely to occur in children with a history of asthma or who develop asthma We therefore inoculated 6 day old mice with sham RV A1B or RV C15 Inflammasome priming and activation were assessed and selected mice treated with recombinant IL 1β Compared to RV A1B infection RV C15 infection induced an exaggerated asthma phenotype with increased mRNA expression of Il5 Il13 Il25 Il33 Muc5ac Muc5b and Clca1 increased lung lineage negative CD25 CD127 ST2 ILC2s increased mucous metaplasia and increased airway responsiveness Lung vRNA induction of pro inflammatory type 1 cytokines and inflammasome priming pro IL 1β and NLRP3 were not different between the two viruses However inflammasome activation mature IL 1β and caspase 1 p12 was reduced in RV C15 infected mice compared to RV A1B infected mice A similar deficiency was found in cultured macrophages Finally IL 1β treatment decreased RV C induced type 2 cytokine and mucus related gene expression ILC2s mucous metaplasia and airway responsiveness but not lung vRNA level We conclude that RV C induces an enhanced asthma phenotype in immature mice Compared to RV A RV C induced macrophage inflammasome activation and IL 1β are deficient permitting exaggerated type 2 inflammation and mucous metaplasia

Influenza viruses cause respiratory infections in humans and animals which have high morbidity and mortality rates Although several drugs that inhibit viral neuraminidase are used to treat influenza infections the emergence of resistant viruses necessitates the urgent development of new antiviral drugs Chrysin 5 7 dihydroxyflavone is a natural flavonoid that exhibits antiviral activity against enterovirus 71 EV71 by inhibiting viral 3C protease activity In this study we evaluated the antiviral activity of chrysin against influenza A Puerto Rico 8 34 A PR 8 Chrysin significantly inhibited A PR 8 mediated cell death and the replication of A PR 8 at concentrations up to 2 μM Viral hemagglutinin expression was also markedly decreased by the chrysin treatment in A PR 8 infected cells Through the time course experiment and time of addition assay we found that chrysin inhibited viral infection at the early stages of the replication cycle Additionally the nucleoprotein expression of A PR 8 in A549 cells was reduced upon treatment with chrysin Regarding the mechanism of action we found that chrysin inhibited autophagy activation by increasing the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR We also confirmed a decrease in LC3B expression and LC3 positive puncta levels in A PR 8 infected cells These results suggest that chrysin exhibits antiviral activity by activating mTOR and inhibiting autophagy to inhibit the replication of A PR 8 in the early stages of infection

Environmental surveillance was recommended for risk mitigation in a novel oral polio vaccine 2 nOPV2 clinical trial M5 ABMG to monitor excretion potential circulation and loss of attenuation of the two nOPV2 candidates The nOPV2 candidates were developed to address the risk of poliovirus PV type 2 circulating vaccine derived poliovirus cVDPV as part of the global eradication strategy Between November 2018 and January 2020 an environmental surveillance study for the clinical trial was conducted in parallel to the M5 ABMG clinical trial at five locations in Panama The collection sites were located upstream from local treatment plant inlets to capture the excreta from trial participants and their community Laboratory analyses of 49 environmental samples were conducted using the two phase separation method Novel OPV2 strains were not detected in sewage samples collected during the study period However six samples were positive for Sabin like type 3 PV two samples were positive for Sabin like type 1 PV and non polio enteroviruses NPEVs were detected in 27 samples One of the nOPV2 candidates has been granted Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization and initial use started in March 2021 This environmental surveillance study provided valuable risk mitigation information to support the Emergency Use Listing application

Infection by RNA viruses causes extensive cellular reorganization including hijacking of membranes to create membranous structures termed replication organelles which support viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly In this study we show that infection with coxsackievirus B3 entails a profound impairment of the protein homeostasis at virus utilized membranes reflected by an accumulation of ubiquitinylated proteins including K48 linked polyubiquitin conjugates known to direct proteins to proteasomal degradation The enrichment of membrane bound ubiquitin conjugates is attributed to the presence of the non structural viral proteins 2B and 3A which are known to perturb membrane integrity and can cause an extensive rearrangement of cellular membranes The locally increased abundance of ubiquitinylated proteins occurs without an increase of oxidatively damaged proteins During the exponential phase of replication the oxidative damage of membrane proteins is even diminished an effect we attribute to the recruitment of glutathione which is known to be required for the formation of infectious virus particles Furthermore we show that the proteasome contributes to the processing of viral precursor proteins Taken together we demonstrate how an infection with coxsackievirus B3 affects the cellular protein and redox homeostasis locally at the site of viral replication and virus assembly

The competing endogenous RNA ceRNA axis has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various viral infections Generally the ceRNA network involves long non coding RNAs lncRNAs that act as sponges for miRNA to regulate mRNA expression However no information is available regarding the involvement of ceRNA networks in Enterovirus type 71 EV71 infections In the present study data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus GEO database was analyzed using various bioinformatics tools EV71 infection in rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells was associated with differential expression of six lncRNAs 28 miRNAs and 349 mRNAs Gene function enrichment analysis suggested induction of cytoplasmic vesicle process upon EV71 infection The ceRNA networks were constructed in which 20 hub genes were predicted by protein protein interaction To confirm the MALAT1 miR 194 5p DUSP1 ceRNA regulatory axis in EV71 infection real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qRT PCR and luciferase reporter assay were performed The results of the study also revealed the involvement of the MALAT1 miR 194 5p axis in apoptosis induced by EV71 infection while no association with autophagy was observed Thus the present study provided novel insights into the pathogenic mechanism of EV71 infection

Picornaviruses are a diverse and major cause of human disease and their genomes replicate with intracellular membranes The functionality of these replication organelles depends on the activities of both viral nonstructural proteins and co opted host proteins The mechanism by which viral host interactions generate viral replication organelles and regulate viral RNA synthesis is unclear To elucidate this mechanism enterovirus A71 EV A71 was used here as a virus model to investigate how these replication organelles are formed and to identify the cellular components that are critical in this process An immunoprecipitation assay was combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LC MS MS analysis to identify 172 cellular proteins and four viral proteins associating with viral 3A protein Secretory carrier membrane protein 3 SCAMP3 was one of the host proteins we selected for further investigation Here we demonstrate by immunoprecipitation assay that SCAMP3 associates with 3A protein and colocalizes with 3A protein during virus infection SCAMP3 knockdown or knockout in infected cells decreases synthesis of EV A71 viral RNA viral proteins and viral growth Furthermore the viral 3A protein associates with SCAMP3 and phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase type III β PI4KIIIβ as shown by immunoprecipitation assay and colocalizes to the replication complex Upon infection of cells with a SCAMP3 knockout construct PI4KIIIβ and phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate PI4P colocalization with EV A71 3A protein decreases viral RNA synthesis also decreases SCAMP3 is also involved in the extracellular signal regulated kinase ERK signaling pathway to regulate viral replication The 3A and SCAMP3 interaction is also important for the replication of coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 SCAMP3 also associates with 3A protein of CVB3 and enhances viral replication but does not regulate dengue virus 2 DENV2 replication Taken together the results suggest that enterovirus 3A protein SCAMP3 PI4KIIIβ and PI4P form a replication complex and positively regulate enterovirus replication

The Delta variant of SARS CoV 2 has caused a new wave of the COVID 19 epidemic in many countries It is the most infectious variant of SARS CoV 2 to date and its high infectivity means that a higher proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to reduce the disease burden which poses a substantial public health challenge

Coxsackievirus A6 CVA6 is a key pathogen causing hand foot and mouth disease HFMD However there are currently no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines for treating infections caused by CVA6 In this study human rhabdomyosarcoma RD African green monkey kidney Vero and human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast KMB17 cells were used to isolate CVA6 from 327 anal swab and fecal samples obtained during HFMD monitoring between 2009 and 2017 The VP1 genes of the isolates were sequenced and genotyped and the biological characteristics of the representative CVA6 strains were analyzed A total of 37 CVA6 strains of the D3 gene subtypes were isolated from RD cells all of which belonged to the epidemic strains in mainland China Using the adaptive culture method 10 KMB17 cell adapted strains were obtained however no Vero cell adapted strains were acquired Among the KMB17 cell adapted strains only KYN A1205 caused disease or partial death in suckling mice and its virulence was stronger than its RD cell adapted strain The pathogenic KYN A1205 strain caused strong tropism to the muscle tissue and led to pathological changes including muscle necrosis and nuclear fragmentation in the forelimb and hindlimb Sequence analysis demonstrated that the KYN A1205 strain exhibited multiple amino acid mutations after KMB17 cell adaptation Moreover it showed strong pathogenicity good immunogenicity and genetic stability and could be used as an experimental CVA6 vaccine candidate

Enteroviruses including the Coxsackievirus Bs CVB have been implicated as causal agents in human type 1 diabetes Immunization of at risk individuals with a CVB vaccine provides an attractive strategy for elucidating the role of CVBs in the disease etiology Previously we have shown that an inactivated whole virus vaccine covering all CVB serotypes CVB1 6 is safe to administer and highly immunogenic in preclinical models including nonhuman primates Before initiating clinical trials with this type of vaccine it was also important to address

Vapendavir is a rhino enterovirus inhibitor that targets a hydrophobic pocket in the viral capsid preventing the virus from entering the cell We set out to study and compare the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vapendavir among clinically relevant Picornavirus species To this end in vitro resistance selection of drug resistant isolates was applied in rhinovirus 2 and 14 enterovirus D68 and Poliovirus 1 Sabin Mutations in the drug binding pocket in VP1 C199R Y in hRV14 I194F in PV1 M252L and A156T in EV D68 typical for this class of compounds were identified Interestingly we also observed mutations located outside the pocket K167E in EV D68 and G149C in hRV2 that contribute to the resistant phenotype Remarkably the G149C substitution rendered the replication of human rhinovirus 2 dependent on the presence of vapendavir Our data suggest that the binding of vapendavir to the capsid of the G149C isolate may be required to stabilize the viral particle and to allow efficient dissemination of the virus We observed the dependency of the G149C isolate on other compounds of this class suggesting that this phenotype is common for capsid binders In addition the VP1 region containing the G149C substitution has not been associated with antiviral resistance before Our results demonstrate that the phenotype and genotype of clinically relevant vapendavir resistant picornavirus species is more complex than generally believed

Enterovirus 71 EV71 poses a major threat to public health globally due to severe and even fatal hand foot and mouth disease HFMD However no effective antiviral agents are available to treat HFMD caused by this virus Polysaccharides have been shown to exhibit antiviral activity and polysaccharides extracted from Picochlorum sp 122 PPE could potentially be used to treat HFMD but reports on their antiviral activity are limited In this study the antiviral activity of PPE against EV71 was verified in Vero cells PPE was shown to limit EV71 infection as demonstrated using an MTT assay and by observing the cellular cytopathic effect In addition a decrease in VP1 RNA and protein levels indicated that PPE effectively inhibits proliferation of EV71 in Vero cells An annexin V affinity assay also indicated that PPE protects host cells from apoptosis through the AKT and ATM ATR signalling pathways These results demonstrate that PPE has potential as an antiviral drug to treat HFMD caused by EV71

Seemingly redundant in function melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 MDA5 and toll like receptor 3 TLR3 both sense RNA viruses and induce type I interferon IFN I Herein we demonstrate that changes in sensing of the same virus by MDA5 and TLR3 can lead to distinct signatures of IFN α and IFN ß resulting in different disease outcomes Specifically infection with a diabetogenic islet β cell tropic strain of coxsackievirus CB4 results in diabetes protection under reduced MDA5 signaling conditions while reduced TLR3 function retains diabetes susceptibility Regulating the induction of IFN I at the site of virus infection creates a local site of interferonopathy leading to loss of T cell regulation and induction of autoimmune diabetes We have not demonstrated another way to prevent T1D in the NOD mouse rather we believe this work has provided compounding evidence for a specific control of IFN I to drive a myriad of responses ranging from virus clearance to onset of autoimmune diabetes

Viral respiratory tract infections cause significant morbidity in bone marrow transplant BMT patients Speed and sensitivity of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel FA RP can improve care but may prompt inappropriate testing Studies describing FA RP use in pediatric BMT patients are limited we investigated FA RP use results and clinical management to evaluate clinical significance of testing in pediatric BMT patients Retrospective analysis of 671 respiratory specimens from 204 unique BMT patients between 01 01 2016 and 01 01 2019 was performed Age underlying diagnoses FA RP result reason for FA RP and symptoms were abstracted FA RP impact on antimicrobial management scheduled procedures infection control measures and hospital admission discharge were investigated Impacts of repeat testing were evaluated Two hundred sixty nine out of 671 specimens 40 tested positive human rhinovirus enterovirus hRV hEV was the most common 161 269 60 The primary reason for FA RP was URI symptoms 402 671 60 with 54 testing positive One hundred twenty two out of 671 18 2 specimens were from asymptomatic patients 14 11 4 tested positive FA RP informed antiviral initiation in 7 19 36 8 7 8 87 5 and 5 30 16 7 of RSV influenza and human parainfluenza cases respectively In 11 cases FA RP informed azithromycin and ceftriaxone initiation continuation or discontinuation BMT was delayed for three positives two RSV one hRV hEV In 22 instances negative FA RP cleared patients for BMT In 70 of cases repeats offered no new clinical information all negative to positive cases had new or worsening respiratory symptoms FA RP was ordered on symptomatic and asymptomatic patients provided rapid diagnosis in 50 of symptomatic patients and informed infection control measures for all inpatients and antiviral initiation in 80 of influenza cases

Enterovirus like the majority of RNA viruses evolves to survive the changeable environments by a variety of strategies Here we showed that HY12 virus evolved to alter its characteristics and pathogenicity by employing a non synonymous mutation Analyses of 5 UTR VP1 and VP2 gene sequences revealed the existence of HY12 virus in an array of mutants defined as quasispecies The determination of diversity and complexity showed that the mutation rate and complexity of HY12 virus quasispecies increased while the proportion of HY12 VP1 and VP2 consensus master sequences decreased with increasing passages Synonymous mutation and non synonymous mutation analysis displayed a positive selection for HY12 quasispecies evolution A comparison of HY12 virus in different passages demonstrated that HY12 virus altered its characteristic phenotype and pathogenicity via non synonymous mutation These findings revealed the evolution pattern for HY12 virus and the alteration of HY12 virus characteristics and pathogenicity by mutation

An Austrian organic dairy sheep farm experienced cases of recumbency and sudden deaths in 3 to 4 week old lambs Two animals were subjected to thorough clinical and pathological investigations Pathohistological analysis identified severe nonsuppurative myelitis and mild nonsuppurative encephalitis A reverse transcription quantitative PCR RT qPCR assay for the recently discovered ovine picornavirus causing comparable lesions scored negative By next generation sequencing based metagenomics a nearly complete genome of a novel enterovirus could be detected and assembled In situ hybridization using a specifically designed probe revealed robust signals in affected motoneurons of the spinal cord suggesting a causative role of the novel virus

Increasing cases related to the pathogenicity of Enterovirus D68 EV D68 have made it a growing worldwide public health concern especially due to increased severe respiratory illness and acute flaccid myelitis AFM in children There are currently no vaccines or medicines to prevent or treat EV D68 infections Herein we performed genome wide transcriptional profiling of EV D68 infected human rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells to investigate host pathogen interplay RNA sequencing and subsequent experiments revealed that EV D68 infection induced a profound transcriptional dysregulation of host genes causing significantly elevated inflammatory responses and altered antiviral immune responses In particular triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 TREM 1 is involved in highly activated TREM 1 signaling processes acting as an important mediator in EV D68 infection and it is related to upregulation of interleukin 8 IL 8 IL 6 IL 12p70 IL 1β and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF α Further results demonstrated that NF κB p65 was essential for EV D68 induced TREM 1 upregulation Moreover inhibition of the TREM1 signaling pathway by the specific inhibitor LP17 dampened activation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK signaling cascade suggesting that TREM 1 mainly transmits activation signals to phosphorylate p38 MAPK Interestingly treatment with LP17 to inhibit TREM 1 inhibited viral replication and infection These findings imply the pathogenic mechanisms of EV D68 and provide critical insight into therapeutic intervention in enterovirus diseases

Comprehensive characterization of exposures and immune responses to viral infections is critical to a basic understanding of human health and disease We previously developed the VirScan system a programmable phage display technology for profiling antibody binding to a library of peptides designed to span the human virome Previous VirScan analytical approaches did not carefully account for antibody cross reactivity among sequences shared by related viruses or for the disproportionate representation of individual viruses in the library

Echovirus 11 E11 is a neurotropic virus that occasionally causes fatal neurological diseases in infected children However the molecular mechanism underlying the disease and pathological spectrum of E11 infection remains unclear Therefore we modelled E11 infection in 2 day old type I interferon receptor knockout IFNAR mice which are susceptible to enteroviruses with E11 and identified symptoms consistent with the clinical signs observed in human cases All organs of infected suckling mice were found to show viral replication and pathological changes the muscle tissue showed the highest viral replication whereas the brain and muscle tissues showed the most obvious pathological changes Brain tissues showed oedema and a large number of dead nerve cells RNA Seq analysis of the brain and hindlimb muscle tissues revealed differentially expressed genes to be abundantly enriched in immune response related pathways with changes in the Guanylate binding protein GBP and MHC class genes causing aseptic meningitis related symptoms Furthermore human glioma U251 cell was identified as sensitive target cells for E11 infection Overall these results provide new insights into the pathogenesis and progress of aseptic meningitis caused by E11

Enteroviruses are globally prevalent human pathogens responsible for many diseases The nonstructural protein 2C is a AAA helicase and plays a key role in enterovirus replication Drug repurposing screens identified 2C targeting compounds such as fluoxetine and dibucaine but how they inhibit 2C is unknown Here we present a crystal structure of the soluble and monomeric fragment of coxsackievirus B3 2C protein in complex with

Surface water used as an irrigation source can be a significant source of viral contamination of fresh produce Enteric viruses such as hepatitis A virus HAV and human norovirus genogroup I HNoV GI and genogroup II HNoV GII can be transmitted to human via fresh produce when irrigated with contaminated water or when prepared by infected food handlers In the current study we investigated the presence of HAV HNoV GI and GII in fresh produce and surface water used in cultivation of this produce using real time PCR Samples were collected from six different points in the Mansoura and Giza regions Egypt Our analysis showed that at least one virus was found in 41 6 30 72 of surface water samples and 27 13 48 of fresh produce samples HAV 23 72 with a mean viral concentration 4 10

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is a major pathogen that causes the hand foot and mouth disease which could be fatal with neurological complications in children The underlying mechanism for the severe pathogenicity remains obscure but impaired or aberrant innate immunity is considered to play a key role in viral pathogenesis We reported previously that EV A71 suppressed type I interferon IFN responses by inducing degradation of karyopherin α1 KPNA1 a component of the p STAT1 2 complex In this report we showed that 2B a non structural protein of EV A71 was critical to the suppression of the IFN α induced type I response in infected cells Among viral proteins 2B was the only one that was involved in the degradation of KPNA1 which impeded the formation of the p STAT1 2 KPNA1 complex and blocked the translocation of p STAT1 2 into the nucleus upon IFN α stimulation Degradation of KPNA1 induced by 2B can be inhibited in the cells pre treated with Z DEVD FMK a caspase 3 inhibitor or siRNA targeting caspase 3 indicating that 2B induced degradation of KPNA1 was caspase 3 dependent The mechanism by which 2B functioned in the dysregulation of the IFN signaling was analyzed and a putative hydrophilic domain H1 in the N terminus of 2B was characterized to be critical for the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol for the activation of pro caspase 3 We generated an EV A71 infectious clone rD1 which was deficient of the H1 domain In rD1 infected cells degradation of KPNA1 was relieved and the infected cells were more sensitive to IFN α leading to decreased viral replication in comparison to the cells infected with the virus carrying a full length 2B Our findings demonstrate that EV A71 2B protein plays an important role in dysregulating JAK STAT signaling through its involvement in promoting caspase 3 dependent degradation of KPNA1 which represents a novel strategy employed by EV A71 to evade host antiviral innate immunity

Limitations in laboratory diagnostic capacity impact population surveillance of COVID 19 It is currently unknown whether participatory surveillance tools for COVID 19 correspond to government reported case trends longitudinally and if it can be used as an adjunct to laboratory testing The primary objective of this study was to determine whether self reported COVID 19 like illness reflected laboratory confirmed COVID 19 case trends in Ontario Canada

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of the motor neuron system associated with both genetic and environmental risk factors Infection with enteroviruses including poliovirus and coxsackievirus such as coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 has been proposed as a possible causal risk factor for ALS due to the evidence that enteroviruses can target motor neurons and establish a persistent infection in the central nervous system CNS and recent findings that enteroviral infection induced molecular and pathological phenotypes closely resemble ALS However a causal relationship has not yet been affirmed

Recombination plays important roles in the genetic diversity and evolution of Enterovirus A71 EV A71 The phylogenetics of EV A71 in mainland China found that one strain DL71 formed a new subgenotype C6 with unknown origin This study investigated the detailed genetic characteristics of the new variant DL71 formed a distinct cluster within genotype C based on the genome and individual genes 5 UTR VP4 VP1 2A 2B 2C 3D and 3 UTR The average genetic distances of the genome and individual genes VP3 2A 2B 2C 3A 3C and 3D between DL71 and reference strains were greater than 0 1 Nine recombination events involving smaller fragments along DL71 genome were detected The strains Fuyang 0805a C4 and Tainan 5746 98 C2 were identified as the parental strains of DL71 In the non recombination regions DL71 had higher identities with Fuyang 0805a than Tainan 5746 98 and located in the cluster with C4 strains However in the recombination regions DL71 had higher identities with Tainan 5746 98 than Fuyang 0805a and located in the cluster with C2 strains Thus DL71 was a novel multiple inter subgenotype recombinant derived from the dominant subgenotype C4 and the sporadic subgenotype C2 strains Monitoring the emergence of new variants by the whole genome sequencing remains essential for preventing disease outbreaks and developing new vaccines

Gestational viral infection has been associated with congenital heart disease CHD Few studies however have studied the potential role of gestational Coxsackievirus B CVB exposure in the pathogenesis of CHD We prospectively enrolled women with pregnancies affected by CHD to explore possible associations with in utero CVB exposure Serum samples were obtained from 122 women referred for fetal echocardiography between 2006 and 2018 We quantified CVB IgG and IgM levels with titers 15 0 U mL considered positive and measured neutralizing antibodies for three CVB serotypes CVB1 CVB3 and CVB4 Using data from the national enterovirus surveillance system we compared the annual exposure rates for each serotype in our cohort to infections reported across the United States 98 pregnancies with no genetic defects were included Overall 29 6 29 98 had positive IgG and 4 1 4 98 of women had positive CVB IgM titers To explore first trimester CVB exposure we focused exclusively on the 26 women with positive IgG and negative IgM titers 61 5 16 26 had neutralizing antibodies against a single serotype and 38 5 10 26 against multiple CVB serotypes CVB4 neutralizing antibodies were the most common 65 4 17 26 followed by CVB3 53 9 14 26 and CVB1 30 8 8 26 Among these 30 8 of babies presented pulmonary valve anomalies 19 2 5 26 pulmonary atresia and 11 5 3 26 pulmonary stenosis 23 1 6 26 of babies had coronary sinusoids CVB exposure in our cohort mirrored that of reported infections in the United States Our results suggest a possible association between gestational CVB exposure and specific CHD particularly pulmonary valve anomalies and coronary sinusoids

Enterovirus infections can cause severe complications such as poliomyelitis encephalitis myocarditis meningitis neurological pulmonary edema and even death Here we used genome wide CRISPR screens to gain new insight into the mechanism by which enteroviruses co opt host pathways to potentiate replication and propagation We found that acyl coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 ACSL4 is involved in viral replication organelle formation ACSL4 is a key component of ferroptosis an iron dependent nonapoptotic programmed cell death Our results indicated that enteroviruses and coronaviruses can induce ferroptosis via ACSL4 Most importantly ferroptosis inhibitors including two FDA approved drugs rosiglitazone ROSI ACSL4 inhibitor and pioglitazone PIO ACSL4 inhibitor decreased the viral load of human enteroviruses and coronaviruses suggesting that ACSL4 is a target for counteracting viral infection

Enterovirus A71 EV71 causes a broad spectrum of childhood diseases ranging from asymptomatic infection or self limited hand foot and mouth disease HFMD to life threatening encephalitis The molecular mechanisms underlying these different clinical presentations remain unknown We hypothesized that EV71 encephalitis in children might reflect an intrinsic host single gene defect of antiviral immunity We searched for mutations in the toll like receptor 3 TLR3 gene Such mutations have already been identified in children with herpes simplex virus encephalitis HSE

This research aimed to explore the association between the RIG I like receptor RIG I and MDA5 encoded by DDX58 and IFIH1 respectively pathways and the risk or severity of hand foot and mouth disease caused by enterovirus 71 EV71 HFMD In this context we explored the influence of gene methylation and polymorphism on EV71 HFMD

In recent years the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has gradually implemented a global shift in polio immunization programs Few studies cover polio immunization program impacts on the efficacy of other vaccines This study investigated whether polio immunization programs affected hepatitis A HepA and hepatitis B HepB vaccination efficacy Serum samples were collected from 968 infants before the first dose of polio vaccine 28 days after completing primary polio immunization and at 24 months old Infants were classified into six polio immunization program groups 1sIPV 2bOPV 2sIPV 1bOPV 2sIPV 1tOPV 1cIPV 2bOPV 2cIPV 1bOPV and 2cIPV 1tOPV sIPV Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine cIPV Salk inactivated poliovirus vaccine b bivalent t trivalent OPV oral polio vaccine No significant differences existed in antibody titers against HepA virus anti HAV among the polio immunization program groups at any of the three time points pre first dose

Multiplex nucleic acid amplification assays that simultaneously detect multiple respiratory pathogens in a single nasopharyngeal swab NPS specimen are widely used for rapid clinical diagnostics We evaluated Allplex Respiratory Panel RP 1 2 3 and the BioFire FilmArray RP assay for detecting respiratory pathogens from NPS specimens In all 181 NPS specimens obtained from patients suspected of having respiratory infections during the non influenza season August December 2019 were included The Allplex RP 1 2 and 3 detected 154 samples positive for respiratory viruses whereas the BioFire FilmArray detected viruses in 98 samples Co infection with two or more viruses was detected in 41 and 17 NPS specimens by Allplex RP and the BioFire FilmArray RP respectively For adenoviruses Allplex RP 1 detected 31 specimens compared to 34 by the BioFire FilmArray In all 64 NPS specimens were positive for human enterovirus HEV and human rhinovirus HRV on the Allplex RP in contrast to 39 HEV HRV on the BioFire FilmArray The parainfluenza virus PIV 1 4 detection rate differed between the two systems Most discrepant results were observed for NPS specimens with high cycle threshold values obtained by Allplex RP This study showed concordant performance of the Allplex RP 1 2 3 and the BioFire FilmArray RP for the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 has circulated worldwide and causes coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 At the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic infection control measures were taken such as hand washing mask wearing and behavioral restrictions However it is not fully clear how the effects of these non pharmaceutical interventions changed the prevalence of other pathogens associated with respiratory infections In this study we collected 3 508 nasopharyngeal swab samples from 3 249 patients who visited the Yamanashi Central Hospital in Japan from March 1 2020 to February 28 2021 We performed multiplex polymerase chain reaction PCR using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel and singleplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR targeting SARS CoV 2 to detect respiratory disease associated pathogens At least one pathogen was detected in 246 7 0 of the 3 508 samples Eleven types of pathogens were detected in the samples collected from March May 2020 during which non pharmaceutical interventions were not well implemented In contrast after non pharmaceutical interventions were thoroughly implemented only five types of pathogens were detected and the majority were SARS CoV 2 adenoviruses or human rhinoviruses enteroviruses The 0 9 year age group had a higher prevalence of infection with adenoviruses and human rhinoviruses enteroviruses compared with those 10 years and older while those 10 years and older had a higher prevalence of infection with SARS CoV 2 and other pathogens These results indicated that non pharmaceutical interventions likely reduced the diversity of circulating pathogens Moreover differences in the prevalence of pathogens were observed among the different age groups

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is an etiological agent of hand foot and mouth disease and can also cause neurological complications in young children However there are no approved drugs as of yet to treat EV71 infections In this study we conducted antiviral drug screening by using a Food and Drug Administration FDA approved drug library We identified five drugs that showed dose dependent inhibition of viral replication Sertraline was further characterized because it exhibited the most potent antiviral activity with the highest selectivity index among the five hits The antiviral activity of sertraline was noted for other EV serotypes The drug s antiviral effect is not likely associated with its approved indications as an antidepressant and its mode of action as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor The time of addition assay revealed that sertraline inhibited an EV71 infection at the entry stage We also showed that sertraline partitioned into acidic compartments such as endolysosomes to neutralize the low pH levels In agreement with the findings the antiviral effect of sertraline could be greatly relieved by exposing virus infected cells to extracellular low pH culture media Ultimately we have identified a use for an FDA approved antidepressant in broad spectrum EV inhibition by blocking viral entry through the alkalization of the endolysosomal route

Infection with enterovirus D68 EV D68 has been linked with severe neurological disease such as acute flaccid myelitis AFM in recent years However active surveillance for EV D68 is lacking which makes full assessment of this association difficult Although a high number of EV D68 infections were expected in 2020 based on the EV D68 s known biannual circulation patterns no apparent increase in EV D68 detections or AFM cases was observed during 2020 We describe an upsurge of EV D68 detections in wastewater samples from the United Kingdom between July and November 2021 mirroring the recently reported rise in EV D68 detections in clinical samples from various European countries We provide the first publicly available 2021 EV D68 sequences showing co circulation of EV D68 strains from genetic clade D and sub clade B3 as in previous years Our results show the value of environmental surveillance ES for the early detection of circulating and clinically relevant human viruses The use of a next generation sequencing NGS approach helped us to estimate the prevalence of EV D68 viruses among EV strains from other EV serotypes and to detect EV D68 minor variants The utility of ES at reducing gaps in virus surveillance for EV D68 and the possible impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions introduced to control the COVID 19 pandemic on EV D68 transmission dynamics are discussed

Here we analyzed six years of acute flaccid paralysis AFP surveillance from 2015 to 2020 of 10 countries linked to the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità Italy The analysis also comprises the polio vaccine coverage available 2015 2019 and enterovirus EV identification and typing data Centralized Information System for Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Data Management System databases were used to obtain data on AFP indicators and laboratory performance and countries vaccine coverage from 2015 to 2019 EV isolation identification and typing were performed by each country according to WHO protocols Overall a general AFP underreporting was observed Non Polio Enterovirus NPEV typing showed a high heterogeneity over the years several genotypes of coxsackievirus and echovirus have been identified The polio vaccine coverage for the data available differs among countries This evaluation allows for the collection for the first time of data from the countries of the Balkan area regarding AFP surveillance and polio vaccine coverage The need for some countries to enhance the surveillance systems and to promote the polio vaccine uptake in order to maintain the polio free status is evident

Numerous viruses manipulate host factors for viral production We demonstrated that human enterovirus A71 EVA71 a primary causative agent for hand foot and mouth disease HFMD increased the level of the DNA damage response DDR marker γ H2AX DDR is primarily mediated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM ATM and Rad3 related ATR or DNA dependent protein kinase DNA PK pathways Upregulation of γ H2AX by EVA71 was dependent on the ATR but not the ATM or DNA PK pathway As a nuclear factor there is no previous evidence of cytoplasmic distribution of γ H2AX However the present findings demonstrated that EVA71 encouraged the localization of γ H2AX to the cytoplasm Of note γ H2AX formed a complex with structural protein VP3 non structural protein 3D and the viral genome Treatment with an inhibitor or CRISPR Cas9 technology to decrease or silence the expression of γ H2AX decreased viral genome replication in host cells this effect was accompanied by decreased viral protein expression and virions In animal experiments caffeine was used to inhibit DDR the results revealed that caffeine protected neonatal mice from death after infection with EVA71 laying the foundation for new therapeutic applications of caffeine More importantly in children with HFMD γ H2AX was upregulated in peripheral blood lymphocytes The consistent

Acute viral myocarditis AVMC most often caused by coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 infection is characterized by myocardial inflammation associated with high morbidity and mortality A pathogenic role for T helper Th 17 cells in AVMC is well established Long noncoding RNA lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 MALAT1 has been shown to play a key role in various inflammatory diseases However the expression of MALAT1 and its impact on Th17 cells differentiation in AVMC remain unclear In the present study we found that MALAT1 was highly expressed in mice with AVMC and the expression was correlated positively with cardiac pathological scores cardiac IL 17 mRNA expression and the percentages of splenic Th17 cells We further demonstrated that MALAT1 knockdown could significantly alleviate the severity of disease and inhibit the differentiation of Th17 cells accompanying the reduced mRNA expression of RORγt and productions of Th17 related pro inflammatory cytokines in vivo Additionally in vitro analysis showed that MALAT1 knockdown suppressed naïve CD4

Waterborne diseases remain a public health concern in developing countries where many lack access to safe water Water testing mainly uses bacterial indicators to assess water quality which may not fully indicate the threat from other non bacterial pathogens like enteric viruses This study was done to ascertain and establish the viral load the temporal and spatial distribution of rotavirus A and norovirus GI and GII in sewage and river water samples A total of 45 samples of raw and treated sewage and surface water were collected from a sludge activated wastewater treatment plant in Gaborone and after treatment from the Notwane River Botswana over a period of 9 months February 2016 to October 2016 Viruses were concentrated using polyethylene glycol NaCl precipitation Virus detection was performed using real time polymerase chain reaction RT PCR Rotavirus A was the most prevalent 84 4 positive samples followed by Norovirus GI 48 9 positive samples and Norovirus GII 46 7 positive samples Detected viral loads went up to 10

Protein kinase B2 AKT2 is involved in various cardiomyocyte signaling processes including those important for survival and metabolism Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 is one of the most common pathogens that cause myocarditis in humans The role of AKT2 in CVB3 infection is not yet well understood We used a cardiac specific AKT2 knockout KO mouse to determine the role of AKT2 in CVB3 mediated myocarditis CVB3 was injected intraperitoneally into wild type WT and KO mice The mice s survival rate was recorded survival in KO mice was significantly decreased compared with WT mice WT vs KO 73 3 vs 27 1 Myocardial damage and inflammation were significantly increased in the hearts of KO mice compared with those of WT mice Moreover from surface ECG AKT2 KO mice showed a prolonged atria and ventricle conduction time PR interval WT vs KO 47 27 1 17 vs 64 79 7 17 ms AKT2 deletion induced severe myocarditis and cardiac dysfunction due to CVB3 infection According to real time PCR the mRNA level of IL 1 IL 6 and TNF α decreased significantly in KO mice compared with WT mice on Days 5 after infection In addition innate immune response antiviral effectors Type I interferon interferon α and β and p62 were dramatically suppressed in the heart of KO mice In particular the adult cardiac myocytes isolated from the heart showed high induction of TLR4 protein in KO mice in comparison with WT AKT2 deletion suppressed the activation of Type I interferon and p62 transcription in CVB3 infection In cardiac myocytes AKT2 is a key signaling molecule for the heart from damage through the activation of innate immunity during acute myocarditis

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is an emerging pathogen which causes respiratory disease and is associated with an acute flaccid myelitis that predominately affects children EV D68 can infect motor neurons causing cell death and a loss of motor control leading to flaccid paralysis However it remains unknown how viral particles gain entry into the central nervous system CNS Here we show that three distinct densities of EV D68 particle can be isolated from infected muscle and neural cell lines RD and SH SY5Y using high speed density centrifugation to separate cell supernatant The lowest density peak is composed of viral particles which have adhered to the exterior surface of a small extracellular vesicle called an exosome Analysis of prototypic historic and contemporary EV D68 strains suggests that binding to exosomes is a ubiquitous characteristic of EV D68 We further show that interaction with exosomes increases viral infectivity in a neural cell line Analysis of the two higher density peaks which are not associated with exosomes revealed that a significant amount of viral titer in the modern 2014 EV D68 strains is found at 1 20 g cm

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is the major pathogen causing severe neurological complications and hand foot and mouth disease The intestinal mucosal immune system has a complete immune response and immune regulation mechanism consisting of densely arranged monolayer intestinal epithelial cells IECs and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes iIELs distributed among the IECs which constitute the first line of intestinal mucosa against infection of foreign pathogens As an enterovirus EV71 is transmitted by the intestinal tract however the mechanisms it uses to evade the immunosurveillance of the intestinal mucosal immune system are still incompletely clarified The present study investigated how EV71 evades from recognizing and eliminating IECs iIELs and iNK cells We found that EV71 infection induced a higher level of type III interferons IFN λ than type I interferons IFN β in IECs and the addition of IFN λ markedly restricted EV71 replication in IECs These results indicate that IFN λ plays a more important role in anti EV71 intestinal infection However EV71 infection could markedly attenuate the antiviral responses of IFN λ Mechanistically 2A protease 2Apro and 3C protease 3Cpro of EV71 inhibited the IFN λ production and IFN λ receptor expression and further decreased the response of IECs to IFN λ In addition we found that EV71 infected IECs were less susceptible to the lysis of intestinal NK iNK cells and CD3

Viral infection of the heart is a common but underappreciated cause of heart failure Viruses can cause direct cardiac damage by lysing infected cardiomyocytes Inflammatory immune responses that limit viral replication can also indirectly cause damage during infection making regulatory factors that fine tune these responses particularly important Identifying and understanding these factors that regulate cardiac immune responses during infection will be essential for developing targeted treatments for virus associated heart failure Our laboratory has discovered Brain Expressed X linked protein 1 BEX1 as a novel stress regulated pro inflammatory factor in the heart Here we report that BEX1 plays a cardioprotective role in the heart during viral infection Specifically we adopted genetic gain and loss of function strategies to modulate BEX1 expression in the heart in the context of coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 induced cardiomyopathy and found that BEX1 limits viral replication in cardiomyocytes Interestingly despite the greater viral load observed in mice lacking BEX1 inflammatory immune cell recruitment in the mouse heart was profoundly impaired in the absence of BEX1 Overall the absence of BEX1 accelerated CVB3 driven heart failure and pathologic heart remodeling This result suggests that limiting inflammatory cell recruitment has detrimental consequences for the heart during viral infections Conversely transgenic mice overexpressing BEX1 in cardiomyocytes revealed the efficacy of BEX1 for counteracting viral replication in the heart in vivo We also found that BEX1 retains its antiviral role in isolated cells Indeed BEX1 was necessary and sufficient to counteract viral replication in both isolated primary cardiomyocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggesting a broader applicability of BEX1 as antiviral agent that extended to viruses other than CVB3 including Influenza A and Sendai virus Mechanistically BEX1 regulated interferon beta IFN β expression in infected cells Overall our study suggests a multifaceted role of BEX1 in the cardiac antiviral immune response

Chronic enterovirus infections can cause significant morbidity particularly in immunocompromised patients This study describes a fatal case associated with a chronic untypeable enterovirus infection in an immunocompromised patient admitted to a Dutch university hospital over nine months We aimed to identify the enterovirus genotype responsible for the infection and to determine potential evolutionary changes Long read sequencing was performed using viral targeted sequence capture on four respiratory and one faecal sample Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a maximum likelihood method along with a root to tip regression and time scaled phylogenetic analysis to estimate evolutionary changes between sample dates Intra host variant detection using a Fixed Ploidy algorithm and selection pressure using a Fixed Effect Likelihood and a Mixed Effects Model of Evolution were also used to explore the patient samples Near complete genomes of enterovirus C104 EV C104 were recovered in all respiratory samples but not in the faecal sample The recovered genomes clustered with a recently reported EV C104 from Belgium in August 2018 Phylodynamic analysis including ten available EV C104 genomes along with the patient sequences estimated the most recent common ancestor to occur in the middle of 2005 with an overall estimated evolution rate of 2 97 10

While infections by enterovirus A71 EV A71 are generally self limiting they can occasionally lead to serious neurological complications and death No licensed therapies against EV A71 currently exist Using anti virus induced cytopathic effect assays 3 4 dicaffeoylquinic acid 3 4 DCQA from Ilex kaushue extracts was found to exert significant anti EV A71 activity with a broad inhibitory spectrum against different EV A71 genotypes Time of drug addition assays revealed that 3 4 DCQA affects the initial phase entry step of EV A71 infection by directly targeting viral particles and disrupting viral attachment to host cells Using resistant virus selection experiments we found that 3 4 DCQA targets the glutamic acid residue at position 98 E98 and the proline residue at position 246 P246 in the 5 fold axis located within the VP1 structural protein Recombinant viruses harboring the two mutations were resistant to 3 4 DCQA elicited inhibition of virus attachment and penetration into human rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells Finally we showed that 3 4 DCQA specifically inhibited the attachment of EV A71 to the host receptor heparan sulfate HS but not to the scavenger receptor class B member 2 SCARB2 and P selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 PSGL1 Molecular docking analysis confirmed that 3 4 DCQA targets the 5 fold axis to form a stable structure with the E98 and P246 residues through noncovalent and van der Waals interactions The targeting of E98 and P246 by 3 4 DCQA was found to be specific accordingly HS binding of viruses carrying the K242A or K244A mutations in the 5 fold axis was successfully inhibited by 3 4 DCQA The clinical utility of 3 4 DCQA in the prevention or treatment of EV A71 infections warrants further scrutiny

There is a growing interest in echovirus 30 E30 an enterovirus responsible for neurological disease and hospitalization There are multiple studies of outbreaks but few that study the epidemiology over long periods of time Our study aims to describe the clinical epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of a series of E30 infections detected over 26 years Data were retrospectively collected from a database of all enterovirus infections identified in our laboratory They were detected by viral isolation or nucleic acid detection in patients presenting with respiratory or neurological infections rash sepsis like syndrome or gastroenteritis Enterovirus genotyping was performed by amplification of the VP1 gene using RT nested PCR followed by sequencing and BLAST analysis Of the 2402 enterovirus infections detected 1619 were linked to at least one genotype and 173 were caused by E30 Clinical information was available for 158 91 3 patients E30 was associated with neurological infection in 107 67 8 cases and it was detected almost every year Phylogenetic analysis was performed with 67 sequences We observed that E30 strains circulating in Catalonia from 1996 to 2016 belong to two lineages E and F although the majority cluster was in F In 2018 lineage I emerged as the dominant lineage

Concurrent outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus serotypes 1 and 2 cVDPV1 cVDPV2 were confirmed in the Republic of the Philippines in September 2019 and were subsequently confirmed in Malaysia by early 2020 There is continuous population subgroup movement in specific geographies between the two countries Outbreak response efforts focused on sequential supplemental immunization activities with monovalent Sabin strain oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 mOPV2 and bivalent oral poliovirus vaccines bOPV containing Sabin strain types 1 and 3 as well as activities to enhance poliovirus surveillance sensitivity to detect virus circulation A total of six cVDPV1 cases 13 cVDPV2 cases and one immunodeficiency associated vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 case were detected and there were 35 cVDPV1 and 31 cVDPV2 isolates from environmental surveillance sewage collection sites No further cVDPV1 or cVDPV2 have been detected in either country since March 2020 Response efforts in both countries encountered challenges particularly those caused by the global COVID 19 pandemic Important lessons were identified and could be useful for other countries that experience outbreaks of concurrent cVDPV serotypes

Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is executed by the gasdermin GSDM N domain of GSDM family proteins which form pores in the plasma membrane Although pyroptosis acts as a host defense against invasive pathogen infection its role in the pathogenesis of enterovirus 71 EV71 infection is unclear In the current study we found that EV71 infection induces cleavage of GSDM E GSDME by using western blotting analysis an essential step in the switch from caspase 3 mediated apoptosis to pyroptosis We show that this cleavage is independent of the 3C and 2A proteases of EV71 However caspase 3 activation is essential for this cleavage as GSDME could not be cleaved in caspase 3 KO cells upon EV71 infection Further analyses showed that EV71 infection induced pyroptosis in WT cells but not in caspase 3 GSDME double KO cells Importantly GSDME is required to induce severe disease during EV71 infection as GSDME deficiency in mice was shown to alleviate pathological symptoms In conclusion our results reveal that GSDME is important for the pathogenesis of EV71 via mediating initiation of pyroptosis

As the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 begins to overlap with the traditional respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere simultaneous testing for SARS CoV 2 and the other common causes of respiratory infections is imperative This has led to the development of multiplex respiratory assays that include SARS CoV 2 as a target One such assay is the BioFire respiratory panel 2 1 RP2 1 which is an expansion of the original BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel 2 RP2 to include SARS CoV 2 In this multicenter evaluation we assessed the performance characteristics of the BioFire RP2 1 for the detection of SARS CoV 2 One or more targets on the panel were detected in 19 3 101 524 of specimens tested with SARS CoV 2 detected in 12 6 66 524 of specimens Human rhinovirus enterovirus was also detected in 32 7 33 101 and adenovirus in 3 0 3 101 of positive specimens with one dual positive for both SARS CoV 2 and adenovirus being detected A further breakdown of pathogens by age revealed a 4 fold predominance of human rhinovirus enterovirus in subjects 0 to 18 years of age whereas in all other age groups SARS CoV 2 was clearly the predominant pathogen Overall SARS CoV 2 results obtained from the BioFire RP2 1 were highly concordant with the composite result exhibiting 98 4 61 62 positive percent agreement 95 confidence interval CI 91 4 to 99 7 and 98 9 457 462 negative percent agreement 95 CI 97 5 to 99 5 with further analysis of discordant results suggesting that the concentration of SARS CoV 2 in the specimens was near the limit of detection LoD for both the BioFire RP2 1 and the comparator assays Overall the BioFire RP2 1 exhibited excellent performance in the detection of SARS CoV 2

Brainstem encephalitis a manifestation of severe enterovirus 71 EV71 infection is an acute excessive inflammatory response The mechanisms underlying its development remain poorly understood Usually neurotropic viruses trigger acute host immune response by engaging cell surface or intracellular receptors Here we show that EV71 engagement with intracellular receptor TLR9 elicits IL 12p40 iNOS signaling causing encephalitis in mice We identified IL 12p40 to be the only prominent cytokine induced at the early infection stage in the brainstem of mice subjected to a lethal dose of EV71 The upregulated IL 12p40 proteins were expressed in glial cells but not neuronal cells To better understand the role of IL 12p40 in severe EV71 infection we treated the EV71 infected mice with an antibody against IL 12p40 and found the mortality rate brainstem inflammation and gliosis to be markedly reduced suggesting that the acute IL 12p40 response plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of brainstem encephalitis Mechanistically intracellular TLR9 was found essential to the activation of the IL 12p40 response Blocking TLR9 signaling with CpG ODN antagonist ameliorated IL 12p40 response brainstem inflammation and limb paralysis in mice with EV71 induced encephalitis We further found the glial IL 12p40 response might damage neurons by inducing excess production of neurotoxic NO by iNOS Overall EV71 engagement with intracellular TLR9 was found to elicit a neurotoxic glial response via IL12p40 iNOS signaling contributing to the neurological manifestation of EV71 infection This pathway could potentially be targeted for the treatment of brainstem encephalitis

Meningitis encephalitis ME syndromic diagnostic assays can be applied for the rapid one step detection of the most common pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid CSF However the comprehensive performance of multiplex assays is still under evaluation In our multisite university hospital of eastern Paris France ME syndromic testing has been gradually implemented since 2017 for patients with neurological symptoms presenting to an adult or pediatric emergency unit We analyzed the results from the BioFire FilmArray ME panel versus standard routine bacteriology and virology techniques together with CSF cytology and clinical data over a 2 5 year period to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the FilmArray ME panel to that of the reference methods In total 1 744 CSF samples from 1 334 pediatric and 336 adult patients were analyzed False positive mostly bacterial and false negative mostly viral cases were deciphered with the help of clinical data The performance of the FilmArray ME panel in our study was better for bacterial detection specificity 99 sensitivity 100 than viral detection specificity 99 sensitivity 75 for herpes simplex virus 1 HSV 1 and 89 for enterovirus our study being one of the largest to date concerning enteroviruses The use of a threshold of 10 leukocytes mm

Coxsackie virus B5 CVB5 a main serotype in human Enterovirus B EVB can cause severe viral encephalitis and aseptic meningitis among infants and children Currently there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy available against CVB5 infection Here we determined the atomic structures of CVB5 in three forms mature full F particle 2 73 Å intermediate altered A particle 2 81 Å and procapsid empty E particle 2 95 Å Structural analysis of F particle of CVB5 unveiled similar structures of canyon puff and knob as those other EV Bs We observed structural rearrangements that are alike during the transition from F to A particle indicative of similar antigenicity cell entry and uncoating mechanisms shared by all EV Bs Further comparison of structures and sequences among all structure known EV Bs revealed that while the residues targeted by neutralizing MAbs are diversified and drive the evolution of EV Bs the relative conserved residues recognized by uncoating receptors could serve as the basis for the development of antiviral vaccines and therapeutics

Human enteroviruses cause many diseases however there is no specific therapeutic drug G quadruplex is an atypical secondary structure formed in the guanine rich region of DNA or RNA which can exist in the viral genome The different positions of G quadruplex play an important role in the regulation of virus replication and infection Whether G quadruplexes are present in human enteroviruses is unknown In current study we analyzed the potential quadruplex forming sequences of human enteroviruses especially EV A71 virus which causes hand foot and mouth disease The results showed that there were a certain number of potential quadruplex forming sequences in human enteroviruses Through a variety of experimental methods we evaluated the formation potential of EV A71 encoded G quadruplex and analyzed the binding ability of G quadruplex ligands including BRACO 19 pyridostatin and TMPyP4 to virus encoded G quadruplexes G quadruplex ligands BRACO 19 PDS and TMPyP4 could inhibit the transcription of constructs containing EV A71 G quadruplex sequences Moreover we found that BRACO 19 was able to inhibit the replication of EV A71 suggesting that targeting G quadruplexes in EV A71 genome by G quadruplex ligands could be a novel antiviral way against EV A71 Our finding not only uncovered the G quadruplexes in human enteroviruses but also would provide a new strategy for human enteroviruses therapy

Rhinovirus is one of the most common respiratory viruses causing both upper and lower respiratory tract infections It affects mainly children and could cause prolonged infections especially in immunocompromised patients Here we report our data on a 15 month surveillance of Rhinovirus seasonality and circulation in Lombardy Region Italy All rhinovirus enterovirus positive samples were amplified with RT PCR for the VP4 VP2 region to assign the correct genotype The median age of RV EV positive patients is 9 years with a range of 0 96 RV A and RV C were detected in the majority of cases while RV B accounted for less than 10 of cases An enterovirus species was detected in 6 45 of the cases A total of 7 of the patients included in this study had a prolonged infection with a median duration of 62 days All these patients were immunocompromised and most of them were pediatric with an RV A infection Two outbreaks were identified mainly in the neonatal intensive care unit NICU and Oncohematology Department caused by RV A89 and C43 respectively Nearly 4 5 of the patients were admitted to the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation all of which had preexisting comorbidities

Enteroviruses EV are implicated in an extensive range of clinical manifestations such as pancreatic failure cardiovascular disease hepatitis and meningoencephalitis We recently reported on the biochemical properties of the highly conserved cysteine residue at position 38 C38 of enteroviral protein 3A and demonstrated a C38 mediated homodimerization of the Coxsackievirus B3 protein 3A CVB3 3A that resulted in its profound stabilization Here we show that residue C38 of protein 3A supports the replication of CVB3 a clinically relevant member of the enterovirus genus The infection of HeLa cells with protein 3A cysteine 38 to alanine mutants C38A attenuates virus replication resulting in comparably lower virus particle formation Consistently in a mouse infection model the enhanced virus propagation of CVB3 3A wt in comparison to the CVB3 3A C38A mutant was confirmed and found to promote severe liver tissue damage In contrast infection with the CVB3 3A C38A mutant mitigated hepatic tissue injury and ameliorated the signs of systemic inflammatory responses such as hypoglycemia and hypothermia Based on these data and our previous report on the C38 mediated stabilization of the CVB3 3A protein we conclude that the highly conserved amino acid C38 in protein 3A enhances the virulence of CVB3

Nineteen CVA9 isolates were obtained between 2010 and 2019 from six provinces of mainland China using the HFMD surveillance network established in China Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the full length VP1 of 19 CVA9 isolates was 906 bases encoding 302 amino acids The combination of the thresholds of the phylogenetic tree and nucleotide divergence of different genotypes within the same serotype led to a value of 15 25 and enabled CVA9 worldwide to be categorized into ten genotypes A J The phylogenetic tree showed that the prototype strain was included in genotype A and that the B C D E H and J genotypes disappeared during virus evolution whereas the F I and G genotypes showed co circulation Lineage G was the dominant genotype of CVA9 and included most of the strains from nine countries in Asia North America Oceania and Europe Most Chinese strains belonged to the G genotype suggesting that the molecular epidemiology of China is consistent with that observed worldwide The 165 partial VP1 strains 723 nt showed a mean substitution rate of 3 27 10

Virus identification is a prerequisite not only for the early diagnosis of viral infectious diseases but also for the effective prevention of epidemics Successful cultivation is the gold standard for identifying a virus according to the Koch postulates However this requires screening for a permissive cell line which is traditionally time reagent and labor intensive Here a simple and easy to operate microfluidic chip formed by seeding a variety of cell lines and culturing them in parallel is reported for use in virus cultivation and virus permissive host cell screening The chip was tested by infection with two known viruses enterovirus 71 EV71 and influenza virus H1N1 Infection with EV71 and H1N1 caused significant cytopathic effects CPE in RD and MDCK cells respectively demonstrating that virus cultivation based on this microfluidic cell chip can be used as a substitute for the traditional plate based culture method and reproduce the typical CPE caused by virus infection Using this microfluidic cell chip method for virus cultivation could make it possible to identify an emerging virus in a high throughput automatic and unprecedentedly fast way

Viral myocarditis VM is an important cause of heart failure HF in children and adults However the molecular determinants involved in cardiac inflammation and cardiomyocyte necrosis remain poorly characterized and cardioprotective molecules are currently missing Here we applied an in vivo method based on the functional selection FunSel of cardioprotective factors using AAV vectors for the unbiased identification of novel immunomodulatory molecules in a Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 induced myocarditis mouse model Two consecutive rounds of in vivo FunSel using an expression library of 60 cytokines were sufficient to identify five cardioprotective factors IL9 IL3 IL4 IL13 IL15 The screening also revealed three cytokines IL18 IL17b and CCL11 that were counter selected and likely to exert a detrimental effect The pooled overexpression of the five most enriched cytokines using AAV9 vectors decreased inflammation and reduced cardiac dilatation persisting at 1 month after treatment Individual overexpression of IL9 the top ranking in our functional selection markedly reduced cardiac inflammation and injury concomitant with an increase of anti inflammatory Th2 cells and a reduction of pro inflammatory Th17 and Th22 cells at 14 days post infection AAV9 mediated FunSel cardiac screening identified IL9 and other four cytokines IL3 IL4 IL13 and IL15 as cardioprotective factors in CVB3 induced VM in mice

Posttranslational modifications PTMs of viral proteins play critical roles in virus infection The role of neddylation in enterovirus 71 EV71 replication remains poorly defined Here we showed that the structural protein VP2 of EV71 can be modified by neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 NEDD8 in an E3 ligase X linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP dependent manner Mutagenesis and biochemical analyses mapped the neddylation site at lysine 69 K69 of VP2 and demonstrated that neddylation reduced the stability of VP2 In agreement with the essential role of VP2 in viral replication studies with EV71 reporter viruses with wild type VP2 enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP EV71 and a K69R mutant VP2 EGFP EV71 VP2 K69R showed that abolishment of VP2 neddylation increased EV71 replication In support of this finding overexpression of NEDD8 significantly inhibited the replication of wild type EV71 and EGFP EV71 but not EGFP EV71 VP2 K69R whereas pharmacologic inhibition of neddylation with the NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 promoted the replication of EV71 in biologically relevant cell types Our results thus support the notion that EV71 replication can be negatively regulated by host cellular and pathobiological cues through neddylation of VP2 protein

RNA interference RNAi is an intrinsic antiviral immune mechanism conserved in diverse eukaryotic organisms However the mechanism by which antiviral RNAi in mammals is regulated is poorly understood In this study we uncovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase STIP1 homology and U box containing protein 1 STUB1 was a new regulator of the RNAi machinery in mammals We found that STUB1 interacted with and ubiquitinated AGO2 and targeted it for degradation in a chaperon dependent manner STUB1 promoted the formation of Lys48 K48 linked polyubiquitin chains on AGO2 and facilitated AGO2 degradation through ubiquitin proteasome system In addition to AGO2 STUB1 also induced the protein degradation of AGO1 AGO3 and AGO4 Further investigation revealed that STUB1 also regulated Dicer s ubiquitination via K48 linked polyubiquitin and induced the degradation of Dicer as well as its specialized form termed antiviral Dicer aviDicer that expresses in mammalian stem cells Moreover we found that STUB1 deficiency up regulated Dicer and AGO2 thereby enhancing the RNAi response and efficiently inhibiting viral replication in mammalian cells Using the newborn mouse model of Enterovirus A71 EV A71 we confirmed that STUB1 deficiency enhanced the virus derived siRNAs production and antiviral RNAi which elicited a potent antiviral effect against EV A71 infection in vivo In summary our findings uncovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 was a general regulator of the RNAi machinery by targeting Dicer aviDicer and AGO1 4 Moreover STUB1 regulated the RNAi response through mediating the abundance of Dicer and AGO2 during viral infection thereby providing novel insights into the regulation of antiviral RNAi in mammals

We studied outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis due to norovirus in schools and summer camps during 2017 2019 in Catalonia Spain The overall attack rate was 21 27 in schools and 33 42 in summer camps RR 0 64 95 CI 0 58 0 70 and 52 63 of outbreaks occurred in cold months and 47 37 in warm months The mean delay in reporting was 5 61 days SD 5 58 days and the mean duration was 6 11 days SD 6 08 days with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0 84

Rhinoviruses RVs are major causes of the common cold but they can also trigger exacerbations of asthma More than 160 different RV strains exist and can be classified into three genetic species RV A RV B and RV C which bind to different receptors on human cells including intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM 1 the low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR or the cadherin related family member 3 CDHR3 Epitopes located in the RV capsid have mainly been determined for RV2 a minor group RV A strain binding to LDLR and for RV14 a major group RV B strain binding to ICAM 1 In order to study epitopes involved in the neutralization of RV89 an ICAM 1 binding RV A strain which is highly different from RV2 and RV14 in terms of receptor specificity and sequence respectively we analyzed the specificity and epitopes of a highly neutralizing antiserum using recombinantly produced RV89 capsid proteins VP1 VP2 VP3 and VP4 recombinant fragments and synthetic overlapping peptides thereof We found that the antiserum which neutralized in vitro RV89 infection up to a dilution of 1 24 000 reacted with the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 but not with VP3 and VP4 The neutralizing antibodies recognized recombinant fragments comprising approximately 100 amino acids of the N and C terminus of VP1 and the middle part of VP2 in particular three peptides which according to molecular modeling based on the three dimensional structure of RV16 were surface exposed on the viral capsid Two recombinant fusion proteins containing the identified peptides fused to hepatitis B HBV derived preS as a carrier protein induced upon immunization of rabbits antibodies capable of neutralizing in vitro RV89 infections Interestingly the virus neutralizing epitopes determined for RV89 corresponded to those determined for minor group RV2 binding to LDL and major group RV14 belonging to the RV B species which are highly different from RV89 Our results indicate that highly different RV strains even when reacting with different receptors seem to engage similar parts of their capsid in the infection process These results may be important for the design of active and passive immunization strategies for RV

Human rhinovirus C HRV C accounts for a large proportion of HRV related illnesses but the immune response to HRV C infection has not been elucidated Our objective was to assess the effect of HRV C on cytokine secretion in human bronchial epithelial HBE cells grown at air liquid interface ALI and compare it with that of respiratory syncytial virus RSV

In the 1950s the epidemic occurrence of infantile paralysis poliomyelitis posed major challenges to health systems worldwide Since there was no causal therapy for the viral disease exposure prophylaxis was of particular importance Ultimately it was only through the development of vaccines that infantile paralysis could be permanently reduced In 1960 the Sabin Tschumakow oral vaccine was administered in the former German Democratic Republic GDR for the first time in Germany Within one year this vaccine succeeded in almost completely eradicating polio in the GDR The article uses unpublished archival material to trace the systematic vaccination campaign using the example of the then district capital Halle Saale There alone 63 328 children and adolescents were immunized within three days in May 1960 With 78 085 vaccinees recorded in advance this corresponded to a rate within the polio vulnerable population group of around 81 The sources show that the GDR s government healthcare system and the principle of outreach vaccination contributed to the success of the vaccination campaign

Platelet factor 4 PF4 or the CXC chemokine CXCL4 is the most abundant protein within the α granules of platelets Previous studies found that PF4 regulates infections of several viruses including HIV 1 H1N1 hepatitis C virus HCV and dengue virus Here we show that PF4 is an inhibitor of enterovirus A71 EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 CA16 infections The secreted form of PF4 from transfected cells or soluble purified PF4 from Escherichia coli even lacking signal peptide affected secretion obviously inhibited the propagation of EV71 and CA16 Mechanistically we demonstrated that PF4 blocked the entry of the virus into the host cells by interactions with VP3 proteins of EV71 CA16 and the interaction with SCARB2 receptor mediated EV71 and CA16 endocytosis As expected the incubation of anti PF4 antibody with PF4 blocked PF4 inhibition on EV71 and CA16 infections further supported the above conclusion Importantly pretreatment of EV71 viruses with PF4 significantly protected the neonatal mice from EV71 lethal challenge and promoted the survival rate of infected mice PF4 derived from natural platelets by EV71 CA16 activation also presented strong inhibition on EV71 and CA16 In summary our study identified a new host factor against EV71 and CA16 infections providing a novel strategy for EV71 and CA16 treatment

The viral etiologies responsible for acute lower respiratory tract infections ALRI are a major cause of pediatric hospitalization and some develop severe diseases requiring pediatric intensive care unit PICU admission The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of viruses and risk factors associated with PICU admission among patients hospitalized for ALRI Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to detect human rhinovirus HRV influenza A and B viruses IAV and IBV parainfluenza viruses PIV and respiratory syncytial virus RSV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction PCR and adenovirus ADV by PCR Of the 5590 pediatric inpatients enrolled respiratory viral infection occurred in 2102 37 60 patients including 1846 33 02 single and 256 4 58 mixed viral infections Among the nasopharyngeal swabs from pediatric inpatients HRV accounted for the highest detection rate 16 48 followed by PIV 8 35 RSV 7 41 ADV 4 63 IAV 3 51 and IBV 2 08 The positive rate of viral tests decreased with increasing age and was higher in males 39 29 than females 34 67 The prevalence of viral infection was the highest in winter 41 57 and lowest in autumn 31 78 Each virus had a seasonal pattern with peaks occurring in months of their epidemic seasons RSV infection and the presence of comorbidities including congenital tracheal stenosis congenital heart disease metabolic disorder immunodeficiency renal disease gastrointestinal disease and neurological disorder might be associated with the need for PICU admission Therefore this study provides useful information for the prevention and control of virus related respiratory diseases and the early identification of and intervention in severe cases

Purpose In this study we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics laboratory findings aetiologies and role of PCR in the decision on the management plan and duration of hospital stay in Jordanian children diagnosed with aseptic meningitis Methods This retrospective observational cohort study included children diagnosed with meningitis who were admitted to the paediatric ward at Jordan University Hospital JUH during the period from January 2016 to August 2020 Patients were identified through the ICD9 discharge code of meningitis Patients diagnosed with aseptic meningitis defined as a patient with signs and symptoms of meningitis with a cerebrospinal fluid CSF white cell count of 5 cells mm

The oral polio vaccine OPV has substantial results in eliminating wild poliovirus and the vaccine of choice in polio eradication However the mucosal immunity induced by the OPV is still uncertain Literature has shown that bovine lactoferrin BLF is a safe and useful protein found in cow s milk with extraordinary antimicrobial antiviral antiinflammatory and immune modulatory functions that help children s gut to fight against micro organisms like poliovirus However limited data exist regarding the effect of BLF on polio vaccine immune response The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of BLF in enhancing mucosal and humoral immunity in children following the administration of oral and inactivated polio vaccines

The antiviral defense directed by the RNAi pathway employs distinct specificity and effector mechanisms compared with other immune responses The specificity of antiviral RNAi is programmed by siRNAs processed from virus derived double stranded RNA by Dicer endonuclease Argonaute containing RNA induced silencing complex loaded with the viral siRNAs acts as the effector to mediate specific virus clearance by RNAi Recent studies have provided evidence for the production and antiviral function of virus derived siRNAs in both undifferentiated and differentiated mammalian cells infected with a range of RNA viruses when the cognate virus encoded suppressor of RNAi VSR is rendered nonfunctional In this review we discuss the function mechanism and evolutionary origin of the validated mammalian VSRs and cell culture assays for their identification

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the circulation of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses in the United States All data were obtained from the US Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program over five consecutive respiratory seasons from 2016 2017 through to 2020 2021 A total of 62 476 specimens were tested for seasonal respiratory viruses The circulating patterns of seasonal respiratory viruses have been greatly altered during the pandemic The 2019 2020 influenza season terminated earlier compared to the pre pandemic seasons and the 2020 2021 influenza season did not occur Moreover weekly test positivity rates dramatically decreased for most of the seasonal respiratory viruses from the start of the pandemic through spring 2021 After the easing of non pharmaceutical interventions NPIs circulations of seasonal coronavirus parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus have returned since spring 2021 High rhinovirus enterovirus activity was evident throughout the 2020 2021 respiratory season The findings suggest a strong association between the remarkably changed activity of seasonal respiratory viruses and the implementation of NPIs during the COVID 19 pandemic The NPIs may serve as an effective public health tool to reduce transmissions of seasonal respiratory viruses

Due to the possibility of wild poliovirus importation from endemic regions and the high circulation of vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 in the African region Mozambique implemented a surveillance program to monitor the circulation of enteroviruses in the environment From January to November 2018 a period that immediately preceded the cVDPV outbreak in Africa 63 wastewater samples were collected from different areas in Maputo city A total of 25 samples 39 7 were positive based on cell culture isolation Non polio enteroviruses were found in 24 samples 24 25 96 whereas 1 Sabin related poliovirus was isolated Neither wild nor vaccine derived poliovirus was detected High circulation of EVB species was detected Environmental surveillance in the One Health approach if effectively applied as support to acute flaccid paralysis can be a powerful aid to the public health system to monitor poliovirus besides non polio enteroviruses in polio free areas

Coxsackievirus B5 CVB5 is one of the most prevalent enteroviruses types in humans and causes annual epidemics worldwide In the present study we explored viral genetic diversity molecular and epidemiological aspects of CVB5 obtained from cerebrospinal fluid and stool samples of patients with aseptic meningitis or acute flaccid paralysis information that is still scarce in Brazil From 2005 to 2018 57 isolates of CVB5 were identified in the scope of the Brazilian Poliomyelitis Surveillance Program Phylogenetic analyses of VP1 sequences revealed the circulation of two CVB5 genogroups with genogroup B circulating until 2017 further replaced by genogroup A Network analysis based on deduced amino acid sequences showed important substitutions in residues known to play critical roles in viral host tropism cell entry and viral antigenicity Amino acid substitutions were investigated by the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer PROVEAN tool which revealed two deleterious substitutions T130N and T130A To the best of our knowledge this is the first report to use in silico approaches to determine the putative impact of amino acid substitutions on the CVB5 capsid structure This work provides valuable information on CVB5 diversity associated with central nervous system CNS infections highlighting the importance of evaluating the biological impact of certain amino acids substitutions associated with epidemiological and structural analyses

Enterovirus A71 EVA71 is a medically important virus that is commonly associated with hand foot and mouth disease HFMD It is responsible for periodic outbreaks resulting in significant economic impact and loss of life Vaccination offers the potential to control future outbreaks and vaccine development has been increasingly the focus of global research efforts However antigenic characterization of vaccine candidates is challenging because there are few tools to characterize the different antigenic forms of the virus As with other picornaviruses EVA71 virions exist in two antigenic states native NAg and expanded HAg It is likely that the composition of vaccines in terms of the proportions of NAg and HAg will be important for vaccine efficacy and batch to batch consistency This paper describes the development of a single chain fused variable scFv domain fragment and the optimization of a sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA for the specific detection of the NAg conformation of EVA71 NAg specificity of the scFv was demonstrated using purified EVA71 and conversion of NAg to HAg by heating resulted in a loss of binding We have thus developed an effective tool for characterization of the specific antigenic state of EVA71

Differentiation of infected from vaccinated hosts DIVH is a critical step in virus eradication programs DIVH compatible vaccines however take years to develop and are therefore unavailable for fighting the sudden outbreaks that typically drive pandemics Here we establish a protocol for the swift and efficient development of DIVH assays and show that this approach is compatible with any type of vaccines Using porcine circovirus 2 PCV2 as the experimental model the first step is to use Immunoglobin G IgG sero dynamics IsD curves to aid epitope discovery IsDAED PCV2 Cap peptides were categorized into three types null interaction nonspecific interaction NSI and specific interaction SI We subsequently compared IsDAED approach and traditional approach and demonstrated identifying SI peptides and excluding NSI peptides supports efficient diagnostic kit development specifically using a protein peptide hybrid microarray PPHM IsDAED directed the design of a DIVH protocol for three types of PCV2 vaccines while using a single PPHM Finally the DIVH protocol successfully differentiated infected pigs from vaccinated pigs at five farms This IsDAED approach is almost certainly extendable to other viruses and host species

Non polio enteroviruses EV and human parechoviruses HPeV are small RNA viruses which in newborns cause infections with a wide range of severity Today molecular biology tools allow us to diagnose viral meningitis in neonates sparing patients from useless antibiotics Data on neurodevelopmental outcome of children who contract enterovirus meningitis in early childhood are still limited in the literature

Although outbreaks of parainfluenza virus type 3 PIV 3 have been reported in children to our knowledge none have been reported in a nursery school As the symptoms of PIV 3 infection are similar to those of COVID 19 infection accurate diagnosis of PIV 3 and other respiratory viruses is important during the COVID 19 pandemic

Long term neurological and neurodevelopmental sequelae are a concerning issue for people with Enterovirus A71 EV A71 central nervous system CNS infection Unfortunately no longitudinal prospective clinical study has systematically investigated the consequences of EV A71 CNS infection during early life on the later development of other psychiatric disorders In this naturalistic longitudinal follow up design we followed forty three youth who got EV A71 CNS involvement 6 18 years ago and were enrolled in other EV A71 clinical studies then Their psychiatric presentation emotional behavioral problems and cognitive issues were examined using a psychiatrist conducted diagnostic interview parent and self rated questionnaires and neuropsychological tests respectively We compared the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in youth with EV A71 CNS involvement to a nationally representative cohort Emotion behavior and cognition in EV A71 CNS infected youth were compared to those in a matched community based sample of healthy controls and youth with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD Compared to a national sample absolute ADHD prevalence 10 1 youth with EV A71 CNS involvement had three times the odds of receiving an ADHD diagnosis standardized prevalence ratio 95 CI 1 8 4 2 absolute ADHD prevalence 34 9 No other psychiatric diagnoses were more common in EV A71 CNS infected youth Compared to community based ADHD youth EV A71 CNS infected youth with psychiatric disorders showed comparable core ADHD symptoms opposition defiance autistic features and suboptimal sustained attention performance based on the Conners Continuous Performance Test all of which were more severe than healthy controls EV A71 CNS infected youth without psychiatric disorders showed comparable autistic features to EV A71 CNS infected youth with psychiatric disorders and ADHD youth EV A71 CNS involvement may cause long term adverse psychiatric outcomes that develop into an ADHD diagnosis alongside social communication emotion problems and autistic features We recommend earlier identification and intervention of these problems among these children

Echoviruses are among the most common worldwide causes of aseptic meningitis which can cause long term sequelae and death particularly in neonates However the mechanisms by which these viruses induce meningeal inflammation are poorly understood owing at least in part to the lack of

Climate change affects the interactions between water systems ecosystems and the atmosphere It also increases the risk of the presence of microorganisms which affect the systems that use these resources The impact of the population on the water resources has become more evident in recent years highlighting the close relationship between the levels of inorganic components and microbiological contamination of water and community health The characterization of the variables that account for water pollution is a complex process In this paper it is proposed to quantified nitrites and phosphorous as chemical markers and fecal coliforms genomic human adenovirus and or picobirnavirus and infectious human enterovirus detection as microbiological markers for the prevention of water borne infections in individuals exposed to superficial aqueous matrices by recreational activities

To determine molecular epidemiology and clinical features of enterovirus D68 EV D68 infections we reviewed EV D68 associated respiratory cases at a hospital in Barcelona Spain during 2014 2021 Respiratory samples were collected from hospitalized patients or outpatients with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection or suggestive of enterovirus infection Enterovirus detection was performed by real time multiplex reverse transcription PCR and characterization by phylogenetic analysis of the partial viral protein 1 coding region sequences From 184 patients with EV D68 infection circulating subclades were B3 80 D1 17 B2 1 and A 1 clade proportions shifted over time EV D68 was detected mostly in children 86 and biennially 2016 2018 2021 In patients 16 years of age the most common sign symptom was lower respiratory tract infection for which 11 8 required pediatric intensive care unit admission and 2 3 required invasive mechanical ventilation neurologic complications developed in 1 The potential neurotropism indicates that enterovirus surveillance should be mandatory

Since 2013 wild poliovirus WPV transmission occurred only for type 1 WPV1 Following several years of increasing reported incidence 2017 2019 and programmatic disruptions caused by COVID 19 early 2020 Pakistan and Afghanistan performed a large number of supplementary immunization activities late 2020 2021 This increased intensity of immunization following widespread transmission substantially decreased WPV1 cases and positive environmental samples during 2021 Modeling the potential for undetected circulation of WPV1 after apparent interruption can support regional and global decisions about certification of the eradication of indigenous WPV1 transmission We apply a stochastic model to estimate the confidence about no circulation CNC of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan as a function of time since the last reported case and or positive environmental sample Exploration of different assumptions about surveillance quality suggests a range for CNC for WPV1 as a function of time since the last positive surveillance signal and supports the potential use of a time with no evidence of transmission of less than 3 years as sufficient to assume die out in the context of good acute flaccid paralysis AFP surveillance We show high expected CNC based on AFP surveillance data alone even with imperfect surveillance and some use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine masking the ability of AFP surveillance to detect transmission Ensuring high quality AFP and environmental surveillance may substantially shorten the time required to reach high CNC The time required for high CNC depends on whether immunization activities maintain high population immunity and the quality of surveillance data

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is a non polio enterovirus that currently represents a major public health concern worldwide In Africa only sporadic cases have been reported Acute flaccid paralysis and environmental surveillance programs have been widely used as strategies for documenting the circulation of polio and non polio enteroviruses To date little is known about the molecular epidemiology of enterovirus A71 in Africa where resources and diagnostic capacities are limited To fill this gap in Senegal a total of 521 non polio enterovirus isolates collected from both acute flaccid paralysis AFP and environmental surveillance ES programs between 2013 and 2020 were screened for enterovirus A71 using real time RT PCR Positive isolates were sequenced and genomic data were analyzed using phylogeny An overall rate of 1 72 9 521 of the analyzed isolates tested positive for enterovirus A71 All positive isolates originated from the acute flaccid paralysis cases and 44 4 4 9 of them were isolated in 2016 The nine newly characterized sequences obtained in our study included eight complete polyprotein sequences and one partial sequence of the VP1 gene all belonging to the C genogroup Seven out of the eight complete polyprotein sequences belonged to the C2 subgenotype while one of them grouped with previous sequences from the C1 subgenotype The partial VP1 sequence belonged to the C1 subgenotype Our data provide not only new insights into the recent molecular epidemiology of enterovirus A71 in Senegal but also point to the crucial need to set up specific surveillance programs targeting non polio enteroviruses at country or regional levels in Africa for rapid identification emerging or re emerging enteroviruses and better characterization of public health concerns causing acute flaccid paralysis in children such as enterovirus A71 To estimate the real distribution of EV A71 in Africa more sero epidemiological studies should be promoted particularly in countries where the virus has already been reported

Enterovirus infections can cause hand foot and mouth disease HFDM aseptic meningitis encephalitis myocarditis and acute flaccid myelitis leading to death of infants and young children However no specific antiviral drug is currently available for the treatment of this type of infection The Unites States and United Kingdom health authorities recently approved a new antiviral drug molnupiravir for the treatment of COVID 19 In this study we reported that molnupiravir EIDD 2801 and its active form EIDD 1931 have broad spectrum anti enterovirus potential Our data showed that EIDD 1931 could significantly reduce the production of EV A71 progeny virus and the expression of EV A71 viral protein at non cytotoxic concentrations The results of the time of addition assay suggest that EIDD 1931 acts at the post entry step which is in accordance with its antiviral mechanism The intraperitoneal administration of EIDD 1931 and EIDD 2801 protected 1 day old ICR suckling mice from lethal EV A71 challenge by reducing the viral load in various tissues of the infected mice The pharmacokinetics analysis indicated that the plasma drug concentration overwhelmed the EC

Coxsackievirus A10 CV A10 is one of the etiological agents associated with hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and also causes a variety of illnesses in humans including pneumonia and myocarditis Different people particularly young children may have different immunological responses to infection Current CV A10 infection animal models provide only a rudimentary understanding of the pathogenesis and effects of this virus The characteristics of CV A10 infection replication and shedding in humans remain unknown In this study rhesus macaques were infected by CV A10 via respiratory or digestive route to mimic the HFMD in humans The clinical symptoms viral shedding inflammatory response and pathologic changes were investigated in acute infection 1 11 day post infection and recovery period 12 180 day post infection All infected rhesus macaques during acute infection showed obvious viremia and clinical symptoms which were comparable to those observed in humans Substantial inflammatory pathological damages were observed in multi organs including the lung heart liver and kidney During the acute period all rhesus macaques displayed clinical signs viral shedding normalization of serum cytokines and increased serum neutralizing antibodies whereas inflammatory factors caused some animals to develop severe hyperglycemia during the recovery period In addition there were no significant differences between respiratory and digestive tract infected animals Overall all data presented suggest that the rhesus macaques provide the first non human primate animal model for investigating CV A10 pathophysiology and assessing the development of potential human therapies

The associations between viral etiology of acute respiratory infections ARI with meteorological factors and air pollutants among children is not fully understood This study aimed to explore the viral etiology among children hospitalized for ARI and the association of meteorological factors and air pollutants with children hospitalization due to viral ARI

Enteroviruses EVs are among the most prevalent viruses worldwide They are characterized by a high genetic and phenotypic diversity being able to cause a plethora of symptoms EV D68 a respiratory EV and EV D94 an enteric EV represent an interesting paradigm of EV tropism heterogeneity They belong to the same species but display distinct phenotypic characteristics and in vivo tropism Here we used these two viruses as well as relevant 3D respiratory intestinal and neural tissue culture models to highlight key distinctive features of enteric and respiratory EVs We emphasize the critical role of temperature in restricting EV D68 tissue tropism Using transcriptomic analysis we underscore fundamental differences between intestinal and respiratory tissues both in the steady state and in response to infection Intestinal tissues present higher cell proliferation rate and are more immunotolerant than respiratory tissues Importantly we highlight the different strategies applied by EV D94 and EV D68 towards the host antiviral response of intestinal and respiratory tissues EV D68 strongly activates antiviral pathways while EV D94 on the contrary barely induces any host defense mechanisms In summary our study provides an insightful characterization of the differential pathogenesis of EV D68 and EV D94 and the interplay with their main target tissues

Human enterovirus A71 EV A71 is the major causative agent of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD commonly associated with severe neurological diseases particularly in children under 5 years of age Several investigational therapeutic agents and vaccine candidates are being developed However no approved drug against EV A71 infection is available and no proven drug target has been identified Since host kinases are key regulators of multiple signaling pathways in response to viral infections here we screened a kinase inhibitor library and identified potent inhibitors against EV A71 infection Among the hits GSK269962A a Rho Associated Coiled Coil Containing Protein Kinase Rock inhibitor with potent antiviral activity was selected for further analysis We found that this Rock inhibitor not only efficiently suppressed the replication of EV A71 in RD cells but also in human intestinal organoids in a dose dependent manner Interestingly small interfering RNA depletion of Rock1 but not Rock2 significantly restricted viral replication in RD cells indicating that Rock1 is a novel host dependency factor for EV A71 replication and can serve as a target for the development of anti EV A71 therapeutics

Several case control studies have been conducted on the relationship between rs3775290 C T and rs3853839 C G single nucleotide polymorphisms of the Toll like receptor TLR gene and hand foot and mouth disease HFMD susceptibility and severity This meta analysis aimed to offer a systemic review of HFMD susceptibility and severity among the Chinese Han population associated with the C T rs3775290 polymorphism of the TLR3 gene or C G rs3853839 polymorphism of the TLR7 gene

Human rhinovirus is a major cause of acute respiratory infections ARIs worldwide Epidemiological data on human rhinovirus RV in Peru is still scarce as well as its role in respiratory infections in children Therefore the aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of rhinovirus and to identify the circulating species in nasopharyngeal swabs from children with acute respiratory infections

There is an intriguing association between winter births and subsequent increased risk of schizophrenia However little is known about the environmental risk factors that contribute this month of birth effect The aims of this study were to carry out a systematic review and meta analysis of studies investigating the month of birth effect in schizophrenia and to explore possible factors such as latitude daylight and infections that could explain this epidemiological observation Medline Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published up to December 23 2021 Study selection data extraction and analysis were undertaken according to Meta analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology MOOSE guidelines Generic inverse variance with random effects models were used to determine the risk ratios RR and 95 confidence intervals CI for each month of birth Associations between variables latitude and daylight were investigated using linear regression and Kendall s rank correlation coefficients were calculated assess the relationship between monthly infections rates schizophrenia births Ten studies were included in the meta analysis encompassing 262 188 schizophrenia patients We identified significantly higher number of schizophrenia births in December 1 04 95 CI 1 00 1 08 January 1 06 95 CI 1 03 1 1 and February 1 03 95 CI 1 00 1 05 We did not find any association between latitude and the magnitude of the month of birth effect On the other hand we found a significant negative correlation between monthly severe enterovirus cases and schizophrenia births tau 0 57 p 0 0099 using data from Taiwan This highlights a role for enterovirus infections in mediating the month of birth effect in schizophrenia and these results carry implications for disease prevention strategies

Virus receptor interactions determine viral host range and tissue tropism CD55 and human neonatal Fc receptor FcRn were found to be the binding and uncoating receptors for some of the echovirus related enterovirus species B serotypes in our previous study Echovirus 18 E18 as a member of enterovirus species B is a significant causative agent of aseptic meningitis and viral encephalitis in children However it does not use CD55 as a critical host factor We conducted CRISPR Cas9 knockout screening to determine the receptors and entry mechanisms and identified FcRn working as a dual function receptor for E18 Knockout of

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is a human pathogen that causes hand foot and mouth disease which can progress to severe neurological disease EV A71 infects humans via the human scavenger receptor B2 hSCARB2 It can also infect neonatal mice experimentally Wild type WT EV A71 strains replicate primarily in the muscle of neonatal mice however susceptibility lasts only for a week after birth Mouse adapted MA strains which can be obtained by serial passages in neonatal mice are capable of infecting both muscle and neurons of the central nervous system It is not clear how the host range and tropism of EV A71 are regulated and why neonatal mice lose their susceptibility during development We hypothesized that EV A71 infection in neonatal mice is mediated by mouse Scarb2 mScarb2 protein Rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells expressing mScarb2 were prepared Both WT and MA strains infected mScarb2 expressing cells but the infection efficiency of the WT strain was much lower than that of the MA strain Infection by WT and MA strains

A randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter trial was conducted in healthy Chinese infants to assess the efficacy and safety of a hexavalent live human bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine HRV against rotavirus gastroenteritis RVGE A total of 6400 participants aged 6 12 weeks were enrolled and randomly assigned to either HRV n 3200 or placebo n 3200 group All the subjects received three oral doses of vaccine four weeks apart The vaccine efficacy VE against RVGE caused by rotavirus serotypes contained in HRV was evaluated from 14 days after three doses of administration up until the end of the second rotavirus season VE against severe RVGE VE against RVGE hospitalization caused by serotypes contained in HRV and VE against RVGE severe RVGE and RVGE hospitalization caused by natural infection of any serotype of rotavirus were also investigated All adverse events AEs were collected for 30 days after each dose Serious AEs SAEs and intussusception cases were collected during the entire study Our data showed that VE against RVGE caused by serotypes contained in HRV was 69 21 95 CI 53 31 79 69 VE against severe RVGE and RVGE hospitalization caused by serotypes contained in HRV were 91 36 95 CI 78 45 96 53 and 89 21 95 CI 64 51 96 72 respectively VE against RVGE severe RVGE and RVGE hospitalization caused by natural infection of any serotype of rotavirus were 62 88 95 CI 49 11 72 92 85 51 95 CI 72 74 92 30 and 83 68 95 CI 61 34 93 11 Incidences of AEs from the first dose to one month post the third dose in HRV and placebo groups were comparable There was no significant difference in incidences of SAEs in HRV and placebo groups This study shows that this hexavalent reassortant rotavirus vaccine is an effective well tolerated and safe vaccine for Chinese infants

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a common child infectious disease caused by more than 20 enterovirus EV serotypes In recent years enterovirus A71 EV A71 has been replaced by Coxsackievirus A6 CV A6 to become the predominant serotype Multiple EV serotypes co circulate in HFMD epidemics and this study aimed to investigate the etiological epidemic characteristics of an HFMD outbreak in Kunming China in 2019

Acute flaccid paralysis AFP surveillance has been used to identify polio cases and target vaccination campaigns since the inception of the Global Poliovirus Eradication Initiative GPEI in 1988 To date only Afghanistan and Pakistan have failed to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission Circulation of vaccine derived polioviruses VDPV continues to be a problem in high risk areas of the Eastern Mediterranean African and Southeast Asian regions Environmental surveillance ES is an important adjunct to AFP surveillance helping to identify circulating polioviruses in problematic areas Stools from AFP cases and contacts 200 000 specimens year and ES samples 642 sites are referred to 146 laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network GPLN for testing Although most World Health Organization supported laboratories use the two phase separation method due to its simplicity and effectiveness alternative simple widely available and cost effective methods are needed The CAFÉ Concentration and Filtration Elution method was developed from existing filtration methods to handle any type of sewage or residual waters At 10 20 US per sample for consumable materials CAFÉ is cost effective and all equipment and reagents are readily available from markets and suppliers globally The report describes the results from a parallel study of CAFÉ method with the standard two phase separation method The study was performed with samples collected from five countries Guatemala Haïti Thailand Papua New Guinea and the Philippines run in three laboratories United States Thailand and in the Philippines to account for regional and sample to sample variability Samples from each site were divided into two 500 ml aliquots and processed by both methods with no other additional concentration or manipulation The results of 338 parallel tested samples show that the CAFÉ method is more sensitive than the two phase separation method for detection of non polio enteroviruses

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is one of the causative agents of hand foot and mouth disease which in some circumstances could lead to severe neurological diseases Despite of its importance for human health little is known about the early stages of EV71 infection EV71 starts uncoating with its receptor human scavenger receptor B2 hSCARB2 at low pH We show that EV71 was not targeted to lysosomes in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells overexpressing hSCARB2 and that the autophagic pathway is not essential for EV71 productive uncoating Instead EV71 was efficiently uncoated 30 min after infection in late endosomes LEs containing hSCARB2 mannose 6 phosphate receptor M6PR RAB9 bis monoacylglycero phosphate and lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 LAMP2 Furthering the notion that mature LEs are crucial for EV71 uncoating cation dependent CD M6PR knockdown impairs EV71 infection Since hSCARB2 interacts with cation independent CI M6PR through M6P binding sites and CD M6PR also harbor a M6P binding site CD M6PR is likely to play important roles in EV71 uncoating in LEs

Infection of Zika virus ZIKV may cause microcephaly and other neurological disorders while no vaccines and drugs are available Our study revealed that rottlerin confers a broad antiviral activity against several enveloped viruses including ZIKV vesicular stomatitis virus and herpes simplex virus but not against two naked viruses enterovirus 71 and encephalomyocarditis virus Rottlerin does not have a direct virucidal effect on the virions and its antiviral effect is independent of its regulation on PKCδ or ATP Both pretreatment and post treatment of rottlerin effectively reduce the viral replication of ZIKV The pretreatment of rottlerin disturbs the endocytosis of enveloped viruses while the post treatment of rottlerin acts at a late stage through disturbing the maturation of ZIKV Importantly administration of rottlerin in neonatal mice significantly decreased the ZIKV replication in vivo and alleviated the neurological symptoms caused by ZIKV Our work suggests that rottlerin exerts an antiviral activity at two distinct steps of viral infection and can be potentially developed as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a common childhood infection caused by human enteroviruses and is clinically characterised by fever with vesicular rash on the hands feet and mouth While enterovirus A71 EV A71 and coxsackievirus A16 CVA16 were the major etiological agents of HFMD in India earlier the data on recently circulating enteroviruses associated with HFMD are sparse Here we describe the molecular epidemiology of enteroviruses associated with HFMD in South India from 2015 to 2017 We used archived enterovirus real time reverse transcription RT PCR positive vesicle swab and or throat swab specimens from clinically suspected HFMD cases collected from four secondary care hospitals in South India between July 2015 and December 2017 PCR amplification and sequencing were done based on the 5 VP1 3 VP1 VP2 or 5 NCR regions to identify enterovirus types Genetic diversity among enteroviruses was inferred by phylogenetic analysis Of the 107 enterovirus RNA real time RT PCR positive HFMD cases 69 64 were typed as CVA6 16 15 were CVA16 and one 1 was CVA10 whereas in 21 20 cases the virus was not typeable by any of the methods used in the study The majority of HFMD cases 89 83 were in children less than five years old while 11 10 3 were in adults 5 VP1 yielded the maximum number of enteroviruses genotyped and phylogenetic analysis showed that the CVA6 strains belonged to subclade D3 while the subclades of CVA16 and CVA10 were B1c and D respectively The predominant etiological agent of HFMD in South India during 2015 2017 was CVA6 followed by CVA16 and CVA10

On July 18 2022 the New York State Department of Health NYSDOH notified CDC of detection of poliovirus type 2 in stool specimens from an unvaccinated immunocompetent young adult from Rockland County New York who was experiencing acute flaccid weakness The patient initially experienced fever neck stiffness gastrointestinal symptoms and limb weakness The patient was hospitalized with possible acute flaccid myelitis AFM Vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 VDPV2 was detected in stool specimens obtained on days 11 and 12 after initial symptom onset To date related Sabin like type 2 polioviruses have been detected in wastewater in the patient s county of residence and in neighboring Orange County up to 25 days before from samples originally collected for SARS CoV 2 wastewater monitoring and 41 days after the patient s symptom onset The last U S case of polio caused by wild poliovirus occurred in 1979 and the World Health Organization Region of the Americas was declared polio free in 1994 This report describes the second identification of community transmission of poliovirus in the United States since 1979 the previous instance in 2005 was a type 1 VDPV 1 The occurrence of this case combined with the identification of poliovirus in wastewater in neighboring Orange County underscores the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent paralytic polio in persons of all ages

Enterovirus A71 EVA71 infection can result in paralysis and may be fatal In common with other picornaviruses empty capsids are produced alongside infectious virions during the viral lifecycle These empty capsids are antigenically indistinguishable from infectious virus but at moderate temperatures they are converted to an expanded conformation In the closely related poliovirus native and expanded antigenic forms of particle have different long term protective efficacies when used as vaccines The native form provides long lived protective immunity while expanded capsids fail to generate immunological protection Whether this is true for EVA71 remains to be determined Here we selected an antigenically stable EVA71 virus population using successive rounds of heating and passage and characterized the antigenic conversion of both virions and empty capsids The mutations identified within the heated passaged virus were dispersed across the capsid including at key sites associated with particle expansion The data presented here indicate that the mutant sequence may be a useful resource to address the importance of antigenic conformation in EVA71 vaccines

Human metapneumovirus HMPV infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in young children with acute respiratory illness In this study we prospectively collected respiratory tract samples from children who were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection in six hospitals in China from 2017 to 2019 HMPV was detected in 145 out of 2733 samples 5 3 from the hospitalized children The majority of HMPV positive children were under the age of two 67 6 with a median age of one year HMPV can independently cause acute lower respiratory tract infection in young children while all patients showed mild clinical symptoms Of all the co infected patients HMPV was most commonly detected with enterovirus EV or rhinovirus RhV 38 0 followed by respiratory syncytial virus RSV 32 0 The highest detection rate occurred from March to May in both northern and southern China Out of 145 HMPV positive samples 48 were successfully typed of which 36 strains were subgrouped into subtypes A2c 75 eight strains were included in subtype B1 16 7 and four strains were included in subtype B2 8 3 Moreover 16 A2c strains contained 111 nucleotide duplications in the G gene Twenty seven complete HMPV genomes were successfully obtained and 25 92 6 strains belonged to subtype A2c whereas one strain was included in subgroup B1 and another was included in subgroup B2 A total of 277 mutations were observed in the complete genomes of 25 A2c strains All results presented here improve our understanding of clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of HMPV infection in children

Immunoproteasomes IP serve as an important modulator of immune responses to pathogens and other pathological factors LMP7 β5i one of the IP subunits plays a critical role in autoimmune diseases by downregulating inflammation Rhinovirus RV infection is a major risk factor in the exacerbations of respiratory inflammatory diseases but whether LMP7 regulates RV mediated inflammation in the lung particularly in the airway epithelium the first line of defense against RV infection remains unclear In this study we determined whether airway epithelial LMP7 promotes the resolution of RV mediated lung inflammation Inducible airway epithelial specific LMP7 deficient conditional knockout CKO mice were generated to reveal the in vivo anti inflammatory and antiviral functions of LMP7 By using LMP7 deficient primary human airway epithelial cells generated by CRISPR Cas9 we confirmed that airway epithelial LMP7 decreased pro inflammatory cytokines and viral load during RV infection Additionally airway epithelial LMP7 enhanced the expression of a negative immune regulator A20 TNFAIP3 during viral infection that may contribute to the anti inflammatory function of LMP7 We also discovered that induction of LMP7 by a low dose of polyinosinic polycytidylic acid PI C reduced RV mediated inflammation in our CKO mice infected with RV Our findings suggest that airway epithelial LMP7 has anti inflammatory and antiviral functions that is critical to the resolution of RV mediated lung inflammation Induction of airway epithelial LMP7 may open a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention against RV infection

To assess the efficacy of washing cloth masks we simulated SARS CoV 2 contamination in tricoline fabric and tested decontaminants to reduce viral particles Viral suspensions using two variants B 1 1 28 and P 1 were inoculated in these fabrics and the inactivation kinetics were evaluated after washing with various household disinfection products Soap powder Lysoform Hypochlorite sodium and 70 Alcohol rinse numbers and exposure times Afterward the fabrics were washed in sterile water and viral RNA was extracted and amplified using RT qPCR Finally viral replication in cell cultures was examined Our findings show that all biocidal treatments successfully disinfected the tissue tested Some products showed less reduction in viral loads such as soap powder 1 60 104 1 04 103 soap powder and Lysoform 1 60 104 1 04 103 and alcohol 70 1 02 103 5 91 101 respectively However when sodium hypochlorite was used this reduction was significantly increased viral inactivation in 100 of the washes After the first wash the reduction in the number of viral particles was greater for the P 1 variant than for the B 1 1 28 variant W 51 759 p 0 05 In conclusion the role of sodium hypochlorite in cloth mask disinfection may also have implications for future health emergencies as well as recommendation by WHO

Echovirus 11 ECHO 11 is a positive strand RNA virus belonging to the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae ECHO 11 infections can cause severe inflammatory illnesses in neonates including severe acute hepatitis with coagulopathy The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is important for host defense against invading viruses which also contributes to viral pathogenicity However whether and how ECHO 11 induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear In this study we isolated a clinical strain of ECHO 11 from stools of an ECHO 11 infected newborn patient with necrotizing hepatitis This virus shared 99 95 sequence identity with the previously published ECHO 11 sequence The clinically isolated ECHO 11 can efficiently infect liver cells and strongly induces inflammation Moreover we showed that ECHO 11 induced IL 1β secretion and pyroptosis in cells and mouse bone marrow derived macrophages BMDMs Furthermore ECHO 11 infection triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation as evidenced by cleavages of GSDMD pro IL 1β and pro caspase 1 and the release of LDH ECHO 11 2B protein was required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation via interacting with NLRP3 to facilitate the inflammasome complex assembly In vivo expression of ECHO 11 2B also activated NLRP3 inflammasome in the murine liver Besides 2Bs of multiple EVs can also interact with NLRP3 and induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation Together our findings demonstrate a mechanism by which ECHO 11 induces inflammatory responses by activating NLRP3 inflammasome providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of ECHO 11 infection

CVA6 is one of Enteroviruses causing worldwide epidemics of HFMD with neurological and systemic complications A suitable animal model is necessary for studying the pathogenesis of CVA6 and evaluating antiviral and vaccine efficacy In this study we generated a mouse adapted CVA6 strain that successfully infected 10 day old ICR mice via oral route All infected mice were paralyzed and died within 11 dpi Analysis of pathological changes and virus loads in fourteen tissues showed that CVA6 triggered systematic damage similar to i p inoculation route Unlike i p route we detected oral and gastrointestinal lesions with the presence of viral antigens Both specific anti CVA6 serum and inactivated vaccines successfully generated immune protection in mice Meanwhile we also established a successful infection of CVA6 via i p and i m route in 10 day old mice After infection mice developed remarkably neurological signs and systemic manifestations such as emaciation polypnea quadriplegia depilation and even death Through i p inoculation pathological examination showed brain and spinal cord damage caused by the virus infection with neuronal reduction apoptosis astrocyte activation and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes Following neurological manifestation the CVA6 infection became systemic and high viral loads were detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes and inflammation Moreover analysis of spleen cells by FACS indicated that CVA6 led to immune system activation which further contributed to systemic inflammation Taken together our novel murine model of CVA6 provides a useful tool for studying the pathogenesis and evaluating antiviral and vaccine efficacy

To cope with the decline in COVID 19 vaccine induced immunity caused by emerging SARS CoV 2 variants a heterologous immunization regimen using chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine expressing SARS CoV 2 spike ChAd S and an inactivated vaccine IV was tested in mice and non human primates NHPs Heterologous regimen successfully enhanced or at least maintained antibody and T cell responses and effectively protected against SARS CoV 2 variants in mice and NHPs An additional heterologous booster in mice further improved and prolonged the spike specific antibody response and conferred effective neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant Interestingly priming with ChAd S and boosting with IV reduced the lung injury risk caused by T cell over activation in NHPs compared to homologous ChAd S regimen meanwhile maintained the flexibility of antibody regulation system to react to virus invasion by upregulating or preserving antibody levels This study demonstrated the satisfactory compatibility of ChAd S and IV in prime boost vaccination in animal models

Polio is disease caused by poliovirus which can in turn cause irreversible paralytic disease presenting as Acute Flaccid Paralysis AFP A sensitive AFP surveillance system in which all reported AFP cases are evaluated first to determine if they are true AFP cases or not is key for tracking polio eradication True AFP cases are then later categorized as polio AFP or non polio AFP NPAFP cases Sensitivity is defined by meeting an annual NPAFP rate 100 000 population 15 years of 4 100 000 and an annual stool adequacy SA rate of 80 We describe Uganda s AFP surveillance performance between 2015 2020 based on the WHO recommended indicators including NPAFP and stool adequacy rate

Attenuation of a virulent virus is a proven approach for generating vaccines but can be unpredictable For example synonymous recoding of viral genomes can attenuate replication but sometimes results in pleiotropic effects that confound rational vaccine design To enable specific conditional attenuation of viruses we examined target RNA features that enable zinc finger antiviral protein ZAP function ZAP recognized CpG dinucleotides and targeted CpG rich RNAs for depletion but RNA features such as CpG numbers spacing and surrounding nucleotide composition that enable specific modulation by ZAP were undefined Using synonymously mutated HIV 1 genomes we defined several sequence features that govern ZAP sensitivity and enable stable attenuation We applied rules derived from experiments with HIV 1 to engineer a mutant enterovirus A71 genome whose attenuation was stable and strictly ZAP dependent both in cell culture and in mice The conditionally attenuated enterovirus A71 mutant elicited neutralizing antibodies that were protective against wild type enterovirus A71 infection and disease in mice ZAP sensitivity can thus be readily applied for the rational design of conditionally attenuated viral vaccines

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 infection is a major cause of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD which may be occasionally associated with severe neurological complications There is currently a lack of treatment options for EV A71 infection The Raf MEK ERK signaling pathway in addition to its critical importance in the regulation of cell growth differentiation and survival has been shown to be essential for virus replication In this study we investigated the anti EV A71 activity of vemurafenib a clinically approved B Raf inhibitor used in the treatment of late stage melanoma Vemurafenib exhibits potent anti EV A71 effect in cytopathic effect inhibition and viral load reduction assays with half maximal effective concentration EC

Viral respiratory tract infections exacerbate airway disease and facilitate life threatening bacterial colonization in cystic fibrosis CF Annual influenza vaccination is recommended and vaccines against other common respiratory viruses may further reduce pulmonary morbidity risk Enteroviruses have been found in nasopharyngeal samples from CF patients experiencing pulmonary exacerbations Using serology tests we found that infections by a group of enteroviruses Coxsackievirus Bs CVBs are prevalent in CF We next showed that a CVB vaccine currently undergoing clinical development prevents infection and CVB instigated lung damage in a murine model of CF Finally we demonstrate that individuals with CF have normal vaccine responses to a similar commonly used enterovirus vaccine inactivated poliovirus vaccine Our study demonstrates that CVB infections are common in CF and provides experimental evidence indicating that CVB vaccines could be efficacious in the CF population The role of CVB infections in contributing to pulmonary exacerbations in CF should be further studied

To monitor vulnerability of countries to poliovirus PV outbreaks serosurveillance of anti PV neutralization antibody is conducted by conventional PV neutralization test cPNT which uses live PV strains We previously developed a pseudovirus PV neutralization test pPNT as an alternative to cPNT which uses PV pseudovirus that expresses luciferase as a reporter in the infection without producing infectious PV In the present study we established a high throughput pPNT HTpPNT for a large scale serosurveillance The HTpPNT system was evaluated with 600 human serum samples obtained from a broad range of age groups of healthy volunteers ages of 0 89 years HTpPNT showed high correlation with cPNT R

Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 is a principal causative agent of viral myocarditis meningitis and pancreatitis There is no vaccine available for clinical use It has been demonstrated that the primary molecular determinant of virulence phenotype is located in the 5 UTR of the viral genome Translation initiation of CVB3 RNA is directed by the IRES element situated in the 5 UTR In the present study we analyse the effects of single point mutations introduced in different positions in the domain V of the IRES RNA of CVB3 wild type We characterize in vitro virus replicative capacitiy and translation efficiency and we test in vivo virulence of different CVB3 mutants produced by the introduction of different mutations in the domain V of IRES by site directed mutagenesis to abolish its structure Our results demonstrate that all RNA mutants display different levels of decreased replication and translation initiation efficiency in vitro The translation defect was correlated with significant reduced viral titer of mutant particles in comparison with the wild type When inoculated in mice mutant viruses were checked for inflammation and necrosis In vitro and in vivo Findings strongly suggest that the most attenuated mutant strain could be considered a candidate for live attenuated CVB3 vaccine

Increases in severe respiratory illness and acute flaccid myelitis AFM among children and adolescents resulting from enterovirus D68 EV D68 infections occurred biennially in the United States during 2014 2016 and 2018 primarily in late summer and fall Although EV D68 annual trends are not fully understood EV D68 levels were lower than expected in 2020 potentially because of implementation of COVID 19 mitigation measures e g wearing face masks enhanced hand hygiene and physical distancing 1 In August 2022 clinicians in several geographic areas notified CDC of an increase in hospitalizations of pediatric patients with severe respiratory illness and positive rhinovirus enterovirus RV EV test results Surveillance data were analyzed from multiple national data sources to characterize reported trends in acute respiratory illness ARI asthma reactive airway disease RAD exacerbations and the percentage of positive RV EV and EV D68 test results during 2022 compared with previous years These data demonstrated an increase in emergency department ED visits by children and adolescents with ARI and asthma RAD in late summer 2022 The percentage of positive RV EV test results in national laboratory based surveillance and the percentage of positive EV D68 test results in pediatric sentinel surveillance also increased during this time Previous increases in EV D68 respiratory illness have led to substantial resource demands in some hospitals and have also coincided with increases in cases of AFM 2 a rare but serious neurologic disease affecting the spinal cord Therefore clinicians should consider AFM in patients with acute flaccid limb weakness especially after respiratory illness or fever and ensure prompt hospitalization and referral to specialty care for such cases Clinicians should also test for poliovirus infection in patients suspected of having AFM because of the clinical similarity to acute flaccid paralysis caused by poliovirus Ongoing surveillance for EV D68 is critical to ensuring preparedness for possible future increases in ARI and AFM

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus PEDV is an emerging and re emerging swine enterovirus that causes highly contagious diarrhoea and mortality in piglets To better understand the current prevalence of PEDV in mid west China and to find out the reason for the re emergence of PEDV from the viral genomic characteristics Herein we firstly investigated epidemiology of PEDV in mid west China from 2019 to 2020 A total of 62 23 257 413 of diarrhoea samples were positive for PEDV and the PEDV positive cases were mainly detected in winter Then we selected the SXSL strain as a representative strain to study the genetic and pathogenic characterization of PEDV pandemic strains in mid west China The recombination analysis showed that SXSL strain was a recombinant strain and the major and minor parent strains of the recombination are CH SCZJ 2018 strain and GDS48 strain respectively Complete genome sequencing and homology analysis showed that the S protein of SXSL strain contained multiple amino acid indels and mutations compared to the PEDV representative strains Furthermore we evaluated the effect of S protein on the infectivity and pathogenicity of PEDV by the PEDV reverse genetics system and results showed that SXSL S protein increased the infectivity and pathogenicity of chimeric virus Overall our findings provided important information for understanding the roles of S protein in the prevalence of PEDV in mid west China and developing vaccines based on PEDV pandemic strains

Enterovirus A71 EV71 infection can cause hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and severe neurological complications in children However the biological processes regulated by EV71 remain poorly understood Herein proteomics and metabonomics studies were conducted to uncover the mechanism of EV71 infection in rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells and identify potential drug targets Differential expressed proteins from enriched membrane were analyzed by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation iTRAQ based proteomics technology Twenty six differential proteins with 1 5 fold p 0 05 change were detected including 14 upregulated proteins and 12 downregulated proteins The upregulated proteins are mainly involved in metabolic process especially in the glycolysis pathway Alpha enolase ENO1 protein was found to increase with temporal dependence following EV71 infection The targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that glucose absorption and glycolysis metabolites were increased after EV71 infection The glycolysis pathway was inhibited by knocking down ENO1 or the use of a glycolysis inhibitor dichloroacetic acid DCA and we found that EV71 infection was inhibited by depleting ENO1 or using DCA Our study indicates that EV71 may reprogram glucose metabolism by activating glycolysis and EV71 infection can be inhibited by interrupting the glycolysis pathway ENO1 may be a potential target against EV71 and DCA could act as an inhibitor of EV71

BackgroundAcute flaccid myelitis AFM is a polio like condition affecting mainly children and involving the central nervous system CNS AFM has been associated with different non polio enteroviruses EVs in particular EV D68 and EV A71 Reliable incidence rates in European countries are not available AimTo report AFM incidence in children in the Netherlands and its occurrence relative to EV D68 and EV A71 detections MethodsIn 10 Dutch hospitals we reviewed electronic health records of patients diagnosed with a clinical syndrome including limb weakness and or CNS infection and who were 18 years old when symptoms started After excluding those with a clear alternative diagnosis to AFM those without weakness and removing duplicate records only patients diagnosed in January 2014 December 2019 were retained and further classified according to current diagnostic criteria Incidence rates were based on definite and probable AFM cases Cases occurrences during the study period were co examined with laboratory surveillance detections of EV D68 and EV A71 ResultsAmong 143 patients included eight were classified as definite and three as probable AFM AFM mean incidence rate was 0 06 100 000 children year 95 CI 0 03 to 0 14 All patient samples were negative for EV A71 Of respiratory samples in seven patients five were EV D68 positive AFM cases clustered in periods with increased EV D68 and EV A71 detections ConclusionsAFM is rare in children in the Netherlands The temporal coincidence of EV D68 circulation and AFM and the detection of this virus in several cases samples support its association with AFM Increased AFM awareness among clinicians adequate diagnostics and case registration matter to monitor the incidence

Human enterovirus 71 EV71 is one of the major agents of the hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and occasionally causes severe neurological complications There is clinical evidence that EV71 infection increases the exosomes in the serum of severe HFMD patients suggesting a role of exosomes in EV71 pathogenesis However the relationship between exosomes and EV71 replication remains elusive In this study we initially found that EV71 infection elevated exosome biogenesis in the cultured cells Among EV71 non structural proteins we identified EV71 3A but not 3B constitutively promoted exosome secretion In detail EV71 3A protein interacted with vacuolar protein sorting 25 VPS25 while knock down of VPS25 reduced EV71 3A protein and EV71 induced exosome production Further studies revealed VPS25 located on exosomes and its expression correlated to the exosome production During EV71 infection knock down of VPS25 decreased exosome biogenesis to attenuate viral replication Consistently GW4869 an exosome inhibitor exerted an obviously antiviral activity against EV71 replication companied with the decrease of exosome secretion or formation These findings suggest the binding of EV71 3A and VPS25 benefited exosome biogenesis thereby boosting viral replication This study uncovers a novel mechanism underlying EV71 mediated exosomes in the regulation of viral replication which provides potential anti viral strategies against the EV71 infection and transmission in HFMD

Oysters are filter feeders and retain sewage derived pathogens in their organs or tissues Since most enteric viruses involved in outbreaks cannot grow in cell culture studies using viral surrogate models are essential Some species are proposed as surrogates for enteric viruses in environmental samples including in bivalve mollusk samples such as murine norovirus type 1 MNV 1 and somatic as φX or F specific coliphages as MS2 bacteriophages This study evaluated the tissue distribution of viral surrogates for enteric virus contamination after their bioaccumulation by Crassostrea gigas Oyster tissues were analyzed for the distribution of viral surrogates MNV 1 φX 174 and MS2 in digestive tissue DT gills GL and mantle MT after 4 6 and 24 h of experimental bioaccumulation MNV 1 had higher counts at 6 h in DT 1 2 10

The ongoing COVID 19 i e coronavirus pandemic continues to adversely affect the human life economy and the world s ecosystem Although significant progress has been made in developing antiviral materials for the coronavirus much more work is still needed In this work N functionalized graphene quantum dots GQDs were designed and synthesized as the antiviral nanomaterial for Feline Coronavirus NTU156 FCoV NTU156 and Enterovirus 71 EV71 with ultra high inhibition 99 9 To prepare the GQD samples a unique solid phase microwave assisted technique was developed and the cell toxicity was established on the H171 and H184 cell lines after 72 h incubation indicating superior biocompatibility The surface functionality of GQDs i e the phenolic and amino groups plays a vital role in interacting with the receptor binding domain of the spike protein It was also found that the addition of polyethylene glycol is advantageous for the dispersion and the adsorption of functionalized GQDs onto the virus surface leading to an enhanced virus inhibition The functionality of as prepared GQD nanomaterials was further confirmed where a functionalized GQD coated glass was shown to be extremely effective in hindering the virus spread for a relatively long period 20 h

A 16 month old previously healthy male is hospitalized for new onset seizures Initial investigation is significant for enterovirus rhinovirus respiratory infection abnormal T2 signal predominantly in the white matter and scattered microhemorrhages on brain MRI transaminitis and thrombocytopenia His symptoms initially improve on steroid therapy and he is discharged from the hospital During the ensuing month with the tapering of the steroids he develops new motor deficits for which he is rehospitalized His laboratory investigation on readmission is unremarkable However there is significant progression of white matter lesions and microhemorrhages on repeat MRI While in the hospital he becomes febrile and has seizure recurrence and worsening neurologic symptoms including cerebral salt wasting and encephalopathy Subsequent neuroimaging demonstrates cerebral edema and diffuse brain injury A high index of suspicion for a rare condition ultimately leads us to perform the specialized testing that confirms the diagnosis We will discuss the diagnostic challenges that arise from an atypical presentation of an uncommon condition and from the disease progression that is modified by previous interventions

TANK binding kinase 1 TBK1 is an essential protein kinase for activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 IRF3 and induction of the type I interferons IFN I Although the biochemical regulation of TBK1 activation has been studied little is known about how enterovirus 71 EV71 employs the deubiquitinases DUBs to regulate TBK1 activation for viral immune evasion Here we found that EV71 infection upregulated the expression of ubiquitin specific protease 24 USP24 Further studies revealed that USP24 physically interacted with TBK1 and can reduce K63 linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 Knockdown of USP24 upregulated TBK1 K63 linked polyubiquitination promoted the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and in turn improved IFN I production during EV71 infection As a consequence USP24 knockdown dramatically inhibited EV71 infection This study revealed USP24 as a novel regulator of TBK1 activation which promotes the understanding of immune evasion mechanisms of EV71 and could provide a potential strategy for treatment of EV71 infection

Poliomyelitis outbreaks due to pathogenic vaccine derived polioviruses VDPVs are threatening and complicating the global polio eradication initiative Most of these VDPVs are genetic recombinants with non polio enteroviruses NPEVs of species C Little is known about factors favoring this genetic macroevolution process Since 2001 Madagascar has experienced several outbreaks of poliomyelitis due to VDPVs and most of VDPVs were isolated in the south of the island The current study explored some of the viral factors that can promote and explain the emergence of recombinant VDPVs in Madagascar

Many viruses are known to trigger endoplasmic reticulum ER stress in host cells which in turn can develop a protective unfolded protein response UPR Depending on the conditions the UPR may lead to either cell survival or programmed cell death One of three UPR branches involves the upregulation of Xbp1 transcription factor caused by the unconventional cytoplasmic splicing of its mRNA This process is accomplished by the phosphorylated form of the endoribonuclease protein kinase Ire1 ERN1 Here we show that the phosphorylation of Ire1 is up regulated in HeLa cells early in enterovirus infection but down regulated at later stages We also find that Ire1 is cleaved in poliovirus and coxsackievirus infected HeLa cells 4 6 h after infection We further show that the Ire1 mediated Xbp1 mRNA splicing is repressed in infected cells in a time dependent manner Thus our results demonstrate the ability of enteroviruses to actively modulate the Ire1 Xbp1 host defensive pathway by inducing phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage of the ER stress sensor Ire1 as well as down regulating its splicing activity Inactivation of Ire1 could be a novel mode of the UPR manipulation employed by viruses to modify the ER stress response in the infected cells

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a major public health problem among children in the Asia Pacific region The optimal specimen for HFMD virological diagnosis remains unclear Enterovirus A71 EV A71 neutralizing antibody titres detected in paired sera were considered the reference standard for calculating the sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive value of throat swabs rectal swabs stool blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid CSF by RT PCR or ELISA assay In this study clinical samples from 276 HFMD patients were collected for analysing the sensitivity of different kind of specimens Our results showed that stool had the highest sensitivity 88 95 CI 74 96 and agreement with the reference standard 91 The order of diagnostic yield for EV A71 infection was stool sample rectal swab throat swab blood sample CSF sample and using a combination of clinical samples improved sensitivity for enterovirus detection The sensitivity of ELISA for IgM antibody detection in sterile site specimens was significantly higher than that of RT PCR serum plasma 62 vs 2 CSF 47 vs 0 P 0 002 In conclusion our results suggest that stool has the highest diagnostic yield for EV A71 infected HFMD If stool is unavailable rectal swabs can be collected to achieve a similar diagnostic yield Otherwise throat swabs may be useful in detecting positive samples Although IgM in blood or CSF is diagnostically accurate it lacks sensitivity missing 40 50 of cases The higher proportion of severe cases and shorter interval between onset and sampling contributed to the increase in congruency between clinical testing and the serological reference standard

Coxsackievirus A10 CV A10 has become one of the major pathogens of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and studies on the vaccine and animal model of CV A10 are still far from complete Our study used a mouse adapted CV A10 strain which was lethal for 14 day old mice to develop an infected mouse model Then this model was employed to establish an actively immunized challenged mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of a formaldehyde inactivated CV A10 vaccine which was prepared from a Vero cell adapted strain CV A10 vaccine at a dose of 0 5 or 2 0 μg was inoculated intraperitoneally in neonatal Kunming mice on the third and ninth day Then the mice were challenged on day 14 The survival rate of mice immunized with 0 5 or 2 0 μg vaccine were 90 and 100 respectively while all Alum inoculated mice died Compared to those in the two vaccinated groups the Alum inoculated mice showed severe pathological damage strong viral protein expression and high viral loads The antisera from vaccinated mice showed high level of neutralizing antibodies against CV A10 Meanwhile three potential T cell epitopes located at the carboxyl terminal regions of the VP1 and VP3 were identified and exhibited CV A10 serotype specific The humoral and cellular immunogenicity analysis showed that immunization with two doses of the vaccine elicited CV A10 specific neutralizing antibody and T cell response in BALB c mice Collectively these findings indicated that this actively immunized challenged mouse model will be invaluable in future studies on CV A10 pathogenesis and evaluation of vaccine candidates

Most children with fever without source FWS require diagnostic laboratory tests to exclude a serious bacterial infection SBI often followed by admission and empirical antibiotics As febrile children with a viral infection are less likely to have a SBI identifying patients with systemic viral infection could contribute to exclude SBI We evaluated whether the presence of virus in the blood could be used as a biomarker to rule out SBI Children 3 years old with FWS were prospectively enrolled and had real time reverse transcription PCR performed on the blood for adenovirus enterovirus parechovirus and HHV6 20 135 patients had SBI and in 47 135 at least one virus was detected in the blood Viremia had a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value 90 and 96 to rule out SBI compared to CRP 65 and 93 and PCT 55 and 90 The odds ratio OR for the presence of SBI among non viremic patients was 5 8 p 0 0225 compared to 5 5 for CRP 40 mg l p 0 0009 and 3 7 for PCT 0 5 ng mL 0 0093 This remained significant after adjusting for CRP and PCT OR 5 6 and 5 9 respectively p 0 03 for both Area under the ROC curve for CRP and PCT were 0 754 and 0 779 respectively but increased to 0 803 and 0 832 respectively when combined with viremia

Despite exhaustive and fully financed plans to manage the risks of globally coordinated cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine OPV containing type 2 OPV2 prior to 2016 as of 2022 extensive continued transmission of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses cVDPVs type 2 cVDPV2 remains Notably cumulative cases caused by cVDPV2 since 2016 now exceed 2 500 Earlier analyses explored the implications of using different vaccine formulations to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and demonstrated how different properties of novel OPV2 nOPV2 might affect its performance compared to Sabin monovalent OPV2 mOPV2 These prior analyses used fixed assumptions for how outbreak response would occur but outbreak response implementation can change We update an existing global poliovirus transmission model to explore different options for responding with different vaccines and assumptions about scope delays immunization intensity target age groups and number of rounds Our findings suggest that in order to successfully stop all cVDPV2 transmission globally countries and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative need to address the deficiencies in emergency outbreak response policy and implementation The polio program must urgently act to substantially reduce response time target larger populations particularly in high transmission areas and achieve high coverage with improved access to under vaccinated subpopulations Given the limited supplies of nOPV2 at the present using mOPV2 intensively immediately followed by nOPV2 intensively if needed and when sufficient quantities become available substantially increases the probability of ending cVDPV2 transmission globally

Group B enteroviruses including coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 can persistently infect cardiac tissue and cause dilated cardiomyopathy Persistence is linked to 5 terminal deletions of viral genomic RNAs that have been detected together with minor populations of full length genomes in human infections In this study we explored the functions and interactions of the different viral RNA forms found in persistently infected patients and their putative role s in pathogenesis Since enterovirus cardiac pathogenesis is linked to the viral proteinase 2A we investigated the effect of different terminal genomic RNA deletions on 2A activity We discovered that 5 terminal deletions in CVB3 genomic RNAs decreased the levels of 2A proteinase activity but could not abrogate it Using newly generated viral reporters encoding nano luciferase we found that 5 terminal deletions resulted in decreased levels of viral protein and RNA synthesis in singly transfected cardiomyocyte cultures Unexpectedly when full length and terminally deleted forms were cotransfected into cardiomyocytes a cooperative interaction was observed leading to increased viral RNA and protein production However when viral infections were carried out in cells harboring 5 terminally deleted CVB3 RNAs a decrease in infectious particle production was observed Our results provide a possible explanation for the necessity of full length viral genomes during persistent infection as they would stimulate efficient viral replication compared to that of the deleted genomes alone To avoid high levels of viral particle production that would trigger cellular immune activation and host cell death the terminally deleted RNA forms act to limit the production of viral particles possibly as

Emergence of 5 terminally deleted coxsackievirus B RNA forms CVB TD have been associated with the development of human diseases These CVB TD RNA forms have been detected in mouse pancreas during acute or persistent experimental infections To date the impact of the replication activities of CVB TD RNA forms on insulin metabolism remains unexplored Using an immunocompetent mouse model of CVB3 28 infection acute and persistent infections of major CVB TD populations were evidenced in the pancreas The inoculation of mice with homogenized pancreases containing major CVB TD populations induced acute and chronic pancreatic infections with pancreatitis In the mouse pancreas viral capsid protein 1 VP1 expression colocalized with a decrease in beta cells insulin content Moreover in infected mouse pancreases we showed a decrease in pro hormone convertase 2 PCSK2 mRNA associated with a decrease in insulin plasmatic concentration Finally transfection of synthetic CVB TD50 RNA forms into cultured rodent pancreatic beta cells demonstrated that viral replication with protein synthesis activities decreased the PCSK2 mRNA expression levels impairing insulin secretion In conclusion our results show that the emergence and maintenance of major CVB TD RNA replicative forms in pancreatic beta cells can play a direct key role in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the development of type 1 diabetes

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is neurotropic and one of the primary enteric pathogens responsible for severe central nervous system infection in infants and young children Neonatal mice are ideal models for studying the pathogenesis of infection caused by EV A71 In this study we assessed the susceptibility of neonatal BALB c C57BL 6 ICR Kunming and NIH mice to a clinically isolated EV A71 strain One day old mice were challenged with a clinical isolate of EV A71 via intraperitoneal injection then observed for 13 days for mortality body weight changes and limb paralysis RT qPCR was performed to quantify viral RNA in the brain spinal cord skeletal muscle and lungs of BALB c and C57BL 6 mice The expression of murine scavenger receptor class B member 2 mSCARB2 was measured by western blotting Finally lesions were assessed by histological examination We found that neonatal BALB c and C57BL 6 mice were both susceptible to EV A71 leading to decreased survival rate greater body weight loss and prominent hind limb paralysis Tissue viral loads of C57BL 6J mice were markedly higher than those of BALB c mice indicating that EV A71 replicated more efficiently in C57BL 6 mice Increased expression of mSCARB2 was observed 5 days after infection in C57BL 6 mice which coincided with the peak in EV A71 replication Histological examination indicated that infection caused obvious pathogenic lesions In conclusion C57BL 6 are most susceptible to infection caused by EV A71 and can be used as a model for studying its pathogenesis and test therapeutic options

Coxsackievirus A6 CA6 is one of the major causative agents of herpangina and hand foot mouth disease HFMD Since 2008 CA6 has circulated widely around the world Especially in Asia Pacific region CA6 had even replaced enterovirus A71 EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 CA16 as the main prevalent strain of HFMD In the recent 10 years monovalent and multivalent vaccines against CA6 have been researched and developed by manufacturers from China Korea and the USA The neutralizing antibody titer is a key indicator for accurately evaluating immunogenicity of vaccine However so far the World Health Organization international standard for CA6 neutralizing antibody has not been available In order to meet the needs of evaluating the immunogenicity of vaccines against CA6 the first Chinese national standard for CA6 neutralizing antibody was established which was conducted to ensure that methods used to measure the neutralizing antibody titers against CA6 are accurate reliable and comparable Three lyophilized candidate standards 29 39 and 44 were produced with 0 40 ml vial from plasma samples donated by healthy individuals The collaborative study showed that the 29 candidate standard could effectively minimize the variability in neutralization titers between labs and across challenging viruses of different genotypes A D1 and D3 Therefore the 29 candidate sample was established as the first Chinese national standard for CA6 neutralizing antibody test This standard has good long term stability and was assigned a potency of 150 units per milliliter U ml of CA6 neutralizing antibody It will contribute to ensure uniformity of potency or activity of vaccines and potentially therapeutic antibody preparations

After the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 Covid 19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 in Wuhan Hubei Province China in late December the cases of Covid 19 have spiralled out around the globe Due to the clinical similarity of Covid 19 with other flulike syndromes patients are assayed for other pathogens of influenza like illness There have been reported cases of co infection amongst patients with Covid 19 Bacteria for example Streptococcus pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus Klebsiella pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumonia Legionella pneumophila etc and viruses such as influenza coronavirus rhinovirus enterovirus parainfluenza metapneumovirus influenza B virus etc are identified as co pathogens In our current effort we develop and analysed a compartmental based Ordinary Differential Equation ODE type mathematical model to understand the co infection dynamics of Covid 19 and other influenza type illness In this work we have incorporated the saturated treatment rate to take account of the impact of limited treatment resources to control the possible Covid 19 cases As results we formulate the basic reproduction number of the model system Finally we have performed numerical simulations of the co infection model to examine the solutions in different zones of parameter space

Febrile seizure FS which occurs in febrile children without underlying health problems is the most common type of seizure disorder in children The suggested pathogenesis of FS derived from several animal and human studies is multifactorial and debatable Neuronal hyperexcitability which develops during inflammatory responses that accompany fever provokes seizures However the exact role of each inflammatory mediator e g cytokines is undefined in terms of the connection between systemic or local inflammation and the central nervous system and the mechanisms by which cytokines increase neuronal excitability remain unclear In contrast the cause of fever in most children with FS is usually mild respiratory virus infection e g rhinovirus influenza virus adenovirus and enterovirus rather than severe bacterial infections In temperate regions the major causative respiratory viruses seem to mirror seasonally prevalent respiratory viruses in the community Therefore vigorous efforts to identify the causative pathogen of fever may not be necessary in children with FS Genetic factors seem to play a role in neuronal hyperexcitability and some types of genetic variation have been identified in several genes encoding ion channels of neurons that participate in neuronal excitation Although most children with FS have benign outcomes some characteristics such as complex FS febrile status epilepticus consecutive afebrile seizures and the presence of neurodevelopmental disabilities may require further genetic and neurologic evaluations

Coxsackievirus CV A6 infections cause hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in children and adults Despite the serious public health threat presented by CV A6 infections our understanding of the mechanisms by which new CV A6 strains emerge remains limited This study investigated the molecular epidemiological trends evolutionary dynamics and recombination characteristics of CV A6 associated HFMD in Thailand between 2019 and 2022 In the HFMD patient samples collected during the 4 year study period we identified enterovirus EV RNA in 368 samples 48 7 of which CV A6 23 7 was the predominant genotype followed by CV A4 6 EV A71 3 7 and CV A16 3 4 According to the partial viral protein VP 1 sequences all these CV A6 strains belonged to the D3 clade Based on the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp gene four recombinant forms RFs RF A 147 84 5 RF N 11 6 3 RF H 1 0 6 and newly RF Y 15 8 6 were identified throughout the study period Results from the similarity plot and bootscan analyses revealed that the 3D polymerase 3Dpol region of the D3 RF Y subclade consists of sequences highly similar to CV A10 We envisage that the epidemiological and evolutionarily insights presented in this manuscript will contribute to the development of vaccines to prevent the spread of CV A6 infection

Rhinoviruses RVs are the most common trigger for asthma exacerbations and there are currently no targeted therapies for viral induced asthma exacerbations RV infection causes neutrophilic inflammation which is often resistant to effects of glucocorticoids IL 1 receptor antagonist IL 1RA treatment reduces neutrophilic inflammation in humans challenged with inhaled endotoxin and thus may have therapeutic potential for RV induced asthma exacerbations

Echovirus 18 has been recognized as an important causative pathogen of aseptic meningitis in young children worldwide and echovirus 18 induced meningitis is rarely found in adults with immunocompetence In this case study we report the clinical and virological characteristics of aseptic meningitis caused by recombinant echovirus 18 in an adult with immunocompetence A 31 year old woman with immunocompetence was admitted to our hospital with fever dizziness severe headache nausea and vomiting for the past 1 day and was diagnosed with viral meningitis based on the clinical manifestations and laboratory results from cerebrospinal fluid CSF The patient received antiviral treatment with ribavirin and interferon as soon as the enterovirus infection was identified using qRT PCR and was cured after 4 days From the oropharyngeal swab and CSF samples two echovirus 18 strains were isolated with a single nucleotide difference located at the 5 UTR Phylogenetic analyses based on the VP1 gene showed that the two strains belonged to the subgenotype C2 and were clustered with sequences obtained from China after 2015 while the results from the 3D polymerase region showed that the two strains were closely related to the E30 strains Bootscanning results using the 5 UTR to 2A region and the 2B to 3 UTR region showed that potential intertypic recombination had occurred in the 2B gene Recombination analyses further confirmed that the two strains echovirus 18 presented genome recombination with echovirus 30 in the nucleotide regions of the 2B gene To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of echovirus 18 induced meningitis in an adult with immunocompetence from mainland China highlighting the need for close surveillance of echovirus 18 both in children and adults in the future

The reported enterovirus A 71 EVA71 vaccines and immunoglobin G IgG antibodies have no cross antiviral efficacy against other enterovirus A EV A which caused hand foot and mouth disease HFMD Here we constructed an IgM antibody 20 IgM based on our previous discovery to address the resistance encountered by IgG based immunotherapy Although binding to the same conserved neutralizing epitope within the GH loop of EV As VP1 the antiviral breath and potency of 20 IgM are still higher than its parental 20 IgG1 The 20 IgM blocks the interaction between the EV As and its receptors scavenger receptor class B member 2 SCARB2 and Kringle containing transmembrane protein 1 KREMEN1 of the host cell The 20 IgM also neutralizes the EV As at the post attachment stages including postattachment neutralization uncoating and RNA release inhibition after internalization Mechanistically the dual blockage effect of 20 IgM is dependent on both a conserved site targeting and high affinity binding Meanwhile 20 IgM provides cross antiviral efficacy in EV As orally infected neonatal ICR mice Collectively 20 IgM and its property exhibit excellent antiviral activity with a dual blockage inhibitory effect at both the pre and post attachment stages The finding enhances our understanding of IgM mediated immunity and highlights the potential of IgM subtype antibodies against enterovirus infections

Coxsackievirus A6 CVA6 a member of species A enterovirus is associated with outbreaks of hand foot and mouth disease and causes a large nationwide burden of disease However the molecular pathogenesis of CVA6 remains unclear In the present study we established a suckling Institute of Cancer Research ICR mouse infection model to explore the neural pathogenicity of CVA6 Five day old mice infected with CVA6 strain F219 showed lethargy and paralysis and died 5 or 6 days after infection via IM injection Cerebral edema and neuronal cell swelling were observed in the infected brain tissue and we found that the CVA6 VP1 antigen could co localize with GFAP positive astrocytes in infected mouse brain using an immunofluorescence assay CVA6 strain F219 can also infect human glioma U251 cells Transcriptome analysis of brain tissues from infected mice and infected U251 cells showed that significantly differentially expressed genes were enriched in antiviral and immune response and neurological system processes These results indicate that CVA6 could cause neural pathogenesis and provide basic data for exploring the mechanism of how host cell interactions affect viral replication and pathogenesis Importance Coxsackievirus A6 CVA6 surpasses the two main pathogens enterovirus 71 EV A71 and coxsackievirus A16 CVA16 which are the leading pathogens causing HFMD in many provinces of China In our study CVA6 infection caused neurogenic pathogenesis in a neonatal murine model manifesting as cerebral edema and neuronal cell swelling CVA6 VP1 antigen could co localize with GFAP positive astrocytes in the infected mouse brain Based on CVA6 infected brain tissue and U251 cell transcriptome analysis we found upregulated antiviral and immune response related genes such as Zbp1 Usp18 Oas2 Irf7 Ddx60 Ifit3 Ddx58 and Isg15 while the neurological system process related genes were downregulated including Fcrls Ebnrb Cdk1 and Anxa5

The interferon delta family was first reported in domestic pigs and belongs to the type I interferon IFN I family The enteric viruses could cause diarrhea in newborn piglets with high morbidity and mortality We researched the function of the porcine IFN delta PoIFN δ family in the porcine intestinal epithelial cells IPEC J2 cells infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus PEDV Our study found that all PoIFN δs shared a typical IFN I signature and could be divided into five branches in the phylogenic tree Different strains of PEDV could induce typical IFN transitorily and the virulent strain AH2012 12 had the strongest induction of porcine IFN δ and IFN alpha PoIFN α in the early stage of infection In addition it was found that PoIFN δ5 6 9 11 and PoIFN δ1 2 were highly expressed in the intestine PoIFN δ5 had a better antiviral effect on PEDV compared to PoIFN δ1 due to its higher induction of ISGs PoIFN δ1 and PoIFN δ5 also activated JAK STAT and IRS signaling For other enteric viruses transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV porcine deltacoronavirus PDCoV and porcine rotavirus PoRV PoIFN δ1 and PoIFN δ5 both showed an excellent antiviral effect Transcriptome analyses uncovered the differences in host responses to PoIFN α and PoIFN δ5 and revealed thousands of differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the inflammatory response antigen processing and presentation and other immune related pathways PoIFN δ5 would be a potential antiviral drug especially against porcine enteric viruses These studies were the first to report the antiviral function against porcine enteric viruses and broaden the new acquaintances of this type of interferon though not novelly discovered

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is an emerging pathogen associated with mild to severe respiratory disease Since 2014 EV D68 is also linked to acute flaccid myelitis AFM causing paralysis and muscle weakness in children However it remains unclear whether this is due to an increased pathogenicity of contemporary EV D68 clades or increased awareness and detection of this virus Here we describe an infection model of primary rat cortical neurons to study the entry replication and functional consequences of different EV D68 strains including historical and contemporary strains We demonstrate that sialic acids are important co receptors for infection of both neurons and respiratory epithelial cells Using a collection of glycoengineered isogenic HEK293 cell lines we show that sialic acids on either N glycans or glycosphingolipids can be used for infection Additionally we show that both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABA ergic neurons are susceptible and permissive to historical and contemporary EV D68 strains EV D68 infection of neurons leads to the reorganization of the Golgi endomembranes forming replication organelles first in the soma and later in the processes Finally we demonstrate that the spontaneous neuronal activity of EV D68 infected neuronal network cultured on microelectrode arrays MEA is decreased independent of the virus strain Collectively our findings provide novel insights into neurotropism and pathology of different EV D68 strains and argue that it is unlikely that increased neurotropism is a recently acquired phenotype of a specific genetic lineage

Rhinovirus RV is one of the most common etiologic agents of acute respiratory infection ARI which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children The clinical significance of RV co detection with other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus RSV remains unclear We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with ARI associated RV only detection and those with RV co detection with an emphasis on RV RSV co detection

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a common viral childhood illness caused most commonly by enterovirus 71 EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 The pathogenesis of EV71 has been extensively studied and the regulation of the host immune response is suspected to aggravate the serious complications induced by EV71 Our previous research showed that EV71 infection significantly increased the release of circulating interleukin IL 6 IL 10 IL 13 and IL 27 Notably these cytokines are related to the EV71 infection risk and clinical stage Polyamines are compounds that are ubiquitous in mammalian cells and play a key role in various cellular processes Several studies have shown that targeting polyamine metabolic pathways can reduce infections caused by viruses However the significance of polyamine metabolism in EV71 infection remains largely unknown

Enterovirus A71 causes severe disease upon systemic infection sometimes leading to life threatening neurological dysfunction However in most cases infection is asymptomatic and limited to the gastrointestinal tract where virus is amplified for transmission Picornaviruses have previously been shown to exit infected cells via either cell lysis or secretion of vesicles Here we report that entire Enterovirus A71 infected cells are specifically extruded from the apical surface of differentiated human colon organoids as observed by confocal microscopy Differential sensitivity to chemical and peptide inhibitors demonstrated that extrusion of virus infected cells is dependent on force sensing via mechanosensitive ion channels rather than apoptotic cell death When isolated and used as inoculum intact virus containing extruded cells can initiate new infections In contrast when mechanical force sensing is inhibited large amounts of free virus are released Thus extrusion of live virus infected cells from intact epithelial tissue is likely to benefit both the integrity of host tissues and the protected spread of this faecal oral pathogen within and between hosts

Neurodegenerative diseases NDs are increasingly common especially in populations with higher life expectancies They are associated mainly with protein metabolism and structure changes leading to neuronal cell death Viral infections affect these cellular processes and may be involved in the etiology of several neurological illnesses particularly NDs Enteroviruses EVs frequently infect the central nervous system CNS causing neurological disease Inflammation disruption of the host autophagy machinery and deregulation and accumulation misfolding of proteins are the main alterations observed after infection by an EV In this perspective we discuss the most recent findings on the subject examining the possible role of EVs in the development of NDs and shedding light on the putative role played by these viruses in developing NDs

Duck hepatitis A virus 1 DHAV 1 is one of the main contagious pathogens that causes rapid death of ducklings To illuminate the potential of DHAV 1 infected underlying mechanisms we analyzed the mRNA and microRNA miRNA expression profiles of duck embryonic hepatocytes DEHs in response to DHAV 1 We found 3410 differentially expressed genes DEGs and 142 differentially expressed miRNAs DEMs at 36 h after DHAV 1 infection Additionally DEGs and the target genes of miRNA expression were analyzed and enriched utilizing GO and KEGG which may be crucial for immune responses viral resistance and mitophagy For instance the dysregulation of DDX58 DHX58 IRF7 IFIH1 STING1 TRAF3 CALCOCO2 OPTN PINK1 and MFN2 in DHAV 1 infected DEHs was verified by RT qPCR Then the association analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs was constructed utilizing the protein protein interaction PPI networks and the expressions of main miRNAs were confirmed including miR 132c 3p miR 6542 3p and novel mir163 These findings reveal a synthetic characterization of the mRNA and miRNA in DHAV 1 infected DEHs and advance the understanding of molecular mechanism in DHAV 1 infection which may provide a hint for the interactions of virus and host

Rhinoviruses RV and enteroviruses EV are among the main causative etiologies of lower respiratory tract infection LRTI in children The clinical spectrum of RV EV infection is wide which could be explained by diverse environmental pathogen and host related factors Little is known about the nasopharyngeal microbiota as a risk factor or disease modifier for RV EV infection in pediatric patients This study describes distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles according to RV EV LRTI status in children

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 which causes severe respiratory diseases and irreversible central nervous system damage has become a serious public health problem worldwide However the mechanisms by which EV D68 exerts neurotoxicity remain unclear Thus we aimed to analyze the effects of EV D68 infection on the cleavage subcellular translocation and pathogenic aggregation of TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa TDP 43 in respiratory or neural cells The results showed that EV D68 encoded proteases 2A and 3C induced TDP 43 translocation and cleavage respectively Specifically 3C cleaved residue 327Q of TDP 43 The 3C mediated cleaved TDP 43 fragments had substantially decreased protein solubility compared with the wild type TDP 43 Hence 3C activity promoted TDP 43 aggregation which exerted cytotoxicity to diverse human cells including glioblastoma T98G cells The effects of commercially available antiviral drugs on 3C mediated TDP 43 cleavage were screened and the results revealed lopinavir as a potent inhibitor of EV D68 3C protease Overall these results suggested TDP 43 as a conserved host target of EV D68 3C This study is the first to provide evidence on the involvement of TDP 43 dysregulation in EV D68 pathogenesis

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a viral infectious disease that occurs in children under 5 years of age Its main causes are coxsackievirus CV and enterovirus EV Since there are no efficient therapeutics for HFMD vaccines are effective in preventing the disease To develop broad coverage against CV and EV the development of a bivalent vaccine form is needed The Mongolian gerbil is an efficient and suitable animal model of EV71 C4a and CVA16 infection used to investigate vaccine efficacy following direct immunization In this study Mongolian gerbils were immunized with a bivalent inactivated EV71 C4a and inactivated CVA16 vaccine to test their effectiveness against viral infection Bivalent vaccine immunization resulted in increased Ag specific IgG antibody production specifically EV71 C4a specific IgG was increased with medium and high doses and CVA16 specific IgG was increased with all doses of immunization When gene expression of T cell biased cytokines was analysed Th1 Th2 and Th17 responses were found to be highly activated in the high dose immunization group Moreover bivalent vaccine immunization mitigated paralytic signs and increased the survival rate following lethal viral challenges When the viral RNA content was determined from various organs all three doses of bivalent vaccine immunization were found to significantly decrease viral amplification Upon histologic examination EV71 C4a and CVA16 induced tissue damage to the heart and muscle However bivalent vaccine immunization alleviated this in a dose dependent manner These results suggest that the bivalent inactivated EV71 C4a CVA16 vaccine could be a safe and effective candidate HFMD vaccine

A rapid virus concentration method is needed to get high throughput Reliable results of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 detection in wastewater are necessary for applications in wastewater based epidemiology In this study an automated filtration method using a concentrating pipette CP Select Innovaprep was applied to detect SARS CoV 2 in wastewater samples with several modifications to increase its sensitivity and throughput The performance of the CP Select method was compared to other concentration methods polyethylene glycol precipitation and direct capture using silica column to evaluate its applicability to SARS CoV 2 detection in wastewater SARS CoV 2 RNA was successfully detected in six of eight wastewater samples using the CP Select method whereas other methods could detect SARS CoV 2 RNA in all wastewater samples Enteric viruses such as noroviruses of genogroups I NoVs GI and II NoVs GII and enteroviruses were tested resulting in 100 NoVs GII detection using all concentration methods As for NoVs GI and enteroviruses all methods gave comparable number of detected samples in wastewater samples This study showed that the optimized CP Select method was less sensitive in SARS CoV 2 detection in wastewater than other methods whereas all methods were applicable to detect or recover other viruses in wastewater

Coxsackievirus A21 CVA21 is a naturally occurring RNA virus that in preclinical studies and clinical trials has demonstrated promising potential in treating a range of malignancies Other oncolytic viruses such as adenovirus vesicular stomatitis virus herpesvirus and vaccinia virus all can be engineered to carry one or more transgenes for various purposes including immune modulation virus attenuation and induction of apoptosis of tumor cells However it remained unknown whether CVA21 can express therapeutic or immunomodulatory payloads due to its small size and high mutation rate Using reverse genetics techniques we demonstrated that a transgene encoding a truncated green fluorescent protein GFP of up to 141 amino acids aa can be successfully carried in the 5 end of the coding region Furthermore a chimeric virus carrying an eel fluorescent protein UnaG 139 aa was also made and shown to be stable and it maintained efficient tumor cell killing activity Similar to other oncolytic viruses the likelihood of delivering CVA21 by the intravenous route is low due to issues like blood absorption neutralizing antibodies and liver clearance To address this problem we designed the CVA21 cDNA under the control of a weak RNA polymerase II promoter and subsequently a stable cell pool in 293T cells was made by integrating the resulting CVA21 cDNA into the cell genome We showed that the cells are viable and able to persistently generate rCVA21

Metabolism is key to cellular processes that underlie the ability of a virus to productively infect Polyamines are small metabolites vital for many host cell processes including proliferation transcription and translation Polyamine depletion also inhibits virus infection via diverse mechanisms including inhibiting polymerase activity and viral translation We showed that Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 attachment requires polyamines however the mechanism was unknown Here we report polyamines involvement in translation through a process called hypusination promotes expression of cholesterol synthesis genes by supporting SREBP2 synthesis the master transcriptional regulator of cholesterol synthesis genes Measuring bulk transcription we find polyamines support expression of cholesterol synthesis genes regulated by SREBP2 Thus polyamine depletion inhibits CVB3 by depleting cellular cholesterol Exogenous cholesterol rescues CVB3 attachment and mutant CVB3 resistant to polyamine depletion exhibits resistance to cholesterol perturbation This study provides a novel link between polyamine and cholesterol homeostasis a mechanism through which polyamines impact CVB3 infection

The same viral infection in different hosts may result in varying levels of clinical symptoms which is related to the genetic background of the host itself A total of 406 common cases and 452 severe cases of enterovirus 71 EV71 infection in Yunnan Province were selected as the research subjects and SNaPshot technology was used to detect genetic polymorphisms for 25 Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms TagSNPs in the selectin P ligand SELPLG and scavenger receptor class B member 2 SCARB2 genes Our results demonstrate that SCARB2 polymorphisms rs74719289 rs3733255 and rs17001551 are related to the severity of EV71 infection A vs G OR 0 330 95 CI 0 115 0 947 T vs C OR 0 336 95 CI 0 118 0 958 and A vs G OR 0 378 95 CI 0 145 0 984 The SELPLG polymorphisms were not significantly different between common cases and severe cases Therefore we conclude that the SCARB2 gene has a protective effect on the course of hand foot and mouth disease caused by EV71 infection and that SCARB2 gene mutations can reduce the severity of the disease

The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic has emphasized the significance of wastewater surveillance in monitoring and tracking the spread of infectious diseases including SARS CoV 2 The wastewater surveillance approach detects genetic fragments from viruses in wastewater which could provide an early warning of outbreaks in communities In this study we determined the concentrations of four types of endogenous viruses including non enveloped DNA crAssphage and human adenovirus 40 41 non enveloped RNA enterovirus and enveloped RNA SARS CoV 2 viruses from wastewater samples using the adsorption extraction AE method with electronegative HA membranes of different pore sizes 0 22 0 45 and 0 80 µm Our findings showed that the membrane with a pore size of 0 80 µm performed comparably to the membrane with a pore size of 0 45 µm for virus detection quantitation repeated measurement one way ANOVA p 0 05 We also determined the recovery efficiencies of indigenous crAssphage and pepper mild mottle virus which showed recovery efficiencies ranging from 50 to 94 and from 20 to 62 respectively Our results suggest that the use of larger pore size membranes may be beneficial for processing larger sample volumes particularly for environmental waters containing low concentrations of viruses This study offers valuable insights into the application of the AE method for virus recovery from wastewater which is essential for monitoring and tracking infectious diseases in communities

Enterovirus 71 EV71 is a predominant causative pathogen of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in children Compared with other HFMD associated viruses EV71 tends to induce more severe neurological complications and even death However the detailed mechanism of EV71 causes nervous system disorder is still unclear In this study we found that EV71 induced the GSDMD NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis of SH SY5Y cells through up regulated miR 146a Through bioinformatic analysis we identified C X C chemokine receptor type 4 CXCR4 as the potential target of miR 146a We noticed that the expression of CXCR4 was regulated by miR 146a during EV71 infection Moreover our results show that over expression of CXCR4 attenuated EV71 induced pyroptosis of SY SY5Y cells These results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism in which EV71 induces nervous system cells damage through regulating miR 146a CXCR4 mediated pyroptosis

Rhinoviruses RVs evoke as many as 85 of acute asthma exacerbations in children and 50 in adults and can induce airway hyperresponsiveness and decrease efficacy of current therapeutics to provide symptom relief Using human precision cut lung slices hPCLSs primary human air liquid interface differentiated airway epithelial cells HAECs and human airway smooth muscle HASM as preclinical experimental models we demonstrated that RV C15 attenuates agonist induced bronchodilation Specifically airway relaxation to formoterol and cholera toxin but not forskolin Fsk was attenuated following hPCLS exposure to RV C15 In isolated HASM cells exposure to conditioned media from RV exposed HAECs decreased cellular relaxation in response to isoproterenol and prostaglandin E

One strategy to counter viruses that persistently cause outbreaks is to design molecules that can specifically inhibit an essential multifunctional viral protease Herein we present such a strategy using well established methods to first identify a region present only in viral but

Coxsackievirus A10 CVA10 causes hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and herpangina which can result in severe neurological symptoms in children CVA10 does not use the common enterovirus 71 EV71 receptor human SCARB2 hSCARB2 scavenger receptor class B member 2 for infection but instead uses another receptor such as KREMEN1 Our research has shown that CVA10 can infect and replicate in mouse cells expressing human SCARB2 3T3 SCARB2 but not in the parental NIH3T3 cells which do not express hSCARB2 for CVA10 entry Knocking down endogenous hSCARB2 and KREMEN1 with specific siRNAs inhibited CVA10 infection in human cells Co immunoprecipitation confirmed that VP1 a main capsid protein where virus receptors for attaching to the host cells could physically interact with hSCARB2 and KREMEN1 during CVA10 infection It is the efficient virus replication following virus attachment to its cellular receptor It resulted in severe limb paralysis and a high mortality rate in 12 day old transgenic mice challenged with CVA10 but not in wild type mice of the same age Massive amounts of CVA10 accumulated in the muscles spinal cords and brains of the transgenic mice Formalin inactivated CVA10 vaccine induced protective immunity against lethal CVA10 challenge and reduced the severity of disease and tissue viral loads This is the first report to show that hSCARB2 serves as an associate to aid CVA10 infection hSCARB2 transgenic mice could be useful in evaluating anti CVA10 medications and studying the pathogenesis induced by CVA10

Among enteroviruses echovirus can cause severe illnesses in neonates or infants with high morbidity and mortality Autophagy a central component of host defense mechanisms can function against diverse infections In the present study we investigated the interplay between echovirus and autophagy We demonstrated that echovirus infection increases LC3 II expression dose dependently accompanied by an increased intracellular LC3 puncta level In addition echovirus infection induces the formation of autophagosome These results suggest that echovirus infection induces autophagy machinery Furthermore phosphorylated mTOR and ULK1 were both decreased upon echovirus infection In contrast both levels of the vacuolar protein sorting 34 VPS34 and Beclin 1 the downstream molecules which play essential roles in promoting the formation of autophagic vesicles increased upon virus infection These results imply that the signaling pathways involved in autophagosome formation were activated by echovirus infection Moreover induction of autophagy promotes echovirus replication and viral protein VP1 expression while inhibition of autophagy impairs VP1 expression Our findings suggest that autophagy can be induced by echovirus infection

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is a globally emerging pathogen causing severe respiratory illnesses mainly in children The protease from EV D68 could impair type I interferon IFN I production However the role of the EV D68 structural protein in antagonizing host antiviral responses remains largely unknown We showed that the EV D68 structural protein VP3 interacted with IFN regulatory factor 7 IRF7 and this interaction suppressed the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF7 and then repressed the transcription of IFN Furthermore VP3 inhibited the TNF receptor associated factor 6 TRAF6 induced ubiquitination of IRF7 by competitive interaction with IRF7 IRF7

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 can elicit a wide variety of human diseases such as hand foot and mouth disease and severe or fatal neurological complications It is not clearly understood what determines the virulence and fitness of EV A71 It has been observed that amino acid changes in the receptor binding protein VP1 resulting in viral binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans HSPGs may be important for the ability of EV A71 to infect neuronal tissue In this study we identified that the presence of glutamine as opposed to glutamic acid at VP1 145 is key for viral infection in a 2D human fetal intestinal model consistent with previous findings in an airway organoid model Moreover pre treatment of EV A71 particles with low molecular weight heparin to block HSPG binding significantly reduced the infectivity of two clinical EV A71 isolates and viral mutants carrying glutamine at VP1 145 Our data indicates that mutations in VP1 leading to HSPG binding enhances viral replication in the human gut These mutations resulting in increased production of viral particles at the primary replication site could lead to a higher risk of subsequent neuroinfection

Enteroviruses are a leading cause of upper respiratory tract gastrointestinal and neurological infections Management of enterovirus related diseases has been hindered by the lack of specific antiviral treatment The pre clinical and clinical development of such antivirals has been challenging calling for novel model systems and strategies to identify suitable pre clinical candidates Organoids represent a new and outstanding opportunity to test antiviral agents in a more physiologically relevant system However dedicated studies addressing the validation and direct comparison of organoids versus commonly used cell lines are lacking Here we described the use of human small intestinal organoids HIOs as a model to study antiviral treatment against human enterovirus 71 EV A71 infection and compared this model to EV A71 infected RD cells We used reference antiviral compounds such as enviroxime rupintrivir and 2

Enteric disease remains one of the most common concerns for public health particularly when it results from human exposure to surface and recreational waters contaminated with wastewater Characterizing the temporal and spatial variation of enteric pathogens prevalent in wastewater is critical to develop approaches to mitigate their distribution in the environment In this study we aim to characterize pathogen variability and test the applicability of the human associated wastewater indicator crAssphage as an indicator of enteric viral and bacterial pathogens We conducted weekly samplings for 14 months from four wastewater treatment plants in North Carolina USA Untreated wastewater samples were processed using hollow fiber ultrafiltration followed by secondary concentration methods Adenovirus norovirus enterovirus Salmonella Shiga toxin 2 stx

Enteroviruses are a group of positive single stranded viruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family They regularly infect humans and cause symptoms ranging from the common cold and hand foot and mouth disease to life threatening conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy and poliomyelitis Enteroviruses have also been associated with chronic immune mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes celiac disease and asthma Studying these disease pathogen connections is challenging due to the high prevalence of enterovirus infections in the population and the transient appearance of the virus during the acute infection phase which limit the identification of the causative agent via methods based on the virus genome Serological assays can detect the antibodies induced by acute and past infections which is useful when direct virus detection is not possible We describe in this immuno epidemiological study how the antibody levels against VP1 proteins from eight different enterovirus types representing all seven of the human infecting enterovirus species vary over time VP1 responses first significantly

Enterovirus consists of a variety of viruses that could cause a wide range of illness in human The pathogenesis of these viruses remains incompletely understood and no specific treatment is available Better methods to study enterovirus infection in live cells will help us better understand the pathogenesis of these viruses and might contribute to antiviral development Here in this study we developed fluorescent cell based reporter systems that allow sensitive distinction of individual cells infected with enterovirus 71 EV71 More importantly these systems could be easily used for live cell imaging by monitoring viral induced fluorescence translocation after EV71 infection We further demonstrated that these reporter systems could be used to study other enterovirus mediated MAVS cleavage and they are sensitive for antiviral activity testing Therefore integration of these reporters with modern image based analysis has the potential to generate new insights into enterovirus infection and facilitate antiviral development

The rapid mutation and spread of SARS CoV 2 variants recently especially through the emerging variants Omicron BA5 BF7 XBB and BQ1 necessitate the development of universal vaccines to provide broad spectrum protection against variants For the SARS CoV 2 universal recombinant protein vaccines an effective approach is necessary to design broad spectrum antigens and combine them with novel adjuvants that can induce high immunogenicity In this study we designed a novel targeted retinoic acid inducible gene I RIG I receptor 5 triphosphate double strain RNA 5 PPP dsRNA based vaccine adjuvant named AT149 and combined it with the SARS CoV 2 Delta and Omicron chimeric RBD dimer recombinant protein D O RBD to immunize mice The results showed that AT149 activated the P65 NF κB signaling pathway which subsequently activated the interferon signal pathway by targeting the RIG I receptor The D O RBD AT149 and D O RBD aluminum hydroxide adjuvant Al AT149 groups showed elevated levels of neutralizing antibodies against the authentic Delta variant and Omicron subvariants BA1 BA5 and BF7 pseudovirus BQ1 1 and XBB compared with D O RBD Al and D O RBD Al CpG7909 Poly I C groups at 14 d after the second immunization respectively In addition D O RBD AT149 and D O RBD Al AT149 groups presented higher levels of the T cell secreted IFN γ immune response Overall we designed a novel targeted RIG I receptor 5 PPP dsRNA based vaccine adjuvant to significantly improve the immunogenicity and broad spectrum of the SARS CoV 2 recombinant protein vaccine

Enterovirus 71 EV71 and coxsackievirus CV A16 are the major etiological agents of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD This report reviewed the full length genomic sequences of EV71 identified in different provinces of China between 1998 and 2019 a total of 312 in addition to eight worldwide reference genomes to address the genomic evolution and genetic events The main prevalent EV71 strians in China are C4 genotypes co circulating with a few A B5 C1 and C2 subgenotypes A new emerging subgenotype in China was identified and classified as B6 genotype Phylogeographic analysis revealed multiple branches where a Jiangsu strain 2006 52 9 GenBank ID KP266579 1 was linked to different subgenotypes through multiple long mutant branches including the CV A16 viruses through the A genotype Furthermore identification of 28 natural recombination events suggests that the emergence of new genotypes are associated with intratypic recombination involving EV71 strains and intertypic recombination between EV71 and CV A16 strains Compared with the structural proteins the non structural proteins of EV71 seem to be highly variable with the highest variable regions of peptidase C3 3C protein P2A and the N terminus of RNA dependent RNA polymerase This study updates the phylogenetic and phylogeographic information of EV71 and provides clues to the emergence of new genotypes of EV71 based on genetics

The factors leading to the global emergence of Enterovirus D68 EV D68 in 2014 as a cause of acute flaccid myelitis AFM in children are unknown To investigate potential changes in virus transmissibility or population susceptibility we measured the seroprevalence of EV D68 specific neutralising antibodies in serum samples collected in England in 2006 2011 and 2017 Using catalytic mathematical models we estimate an approximately 50 increase in the annual probability of infection over the 10 year study period coinciding with the emergence of clade B around 2009 Despite such increase in transmission seroprevalence data suggest that the virus was already widely circulating before the AFM outbreaks and the increase of infections by age cannot explain the observed number of AFM cases Therefore the acquisition of or an increase in neuropathogenicity would be additionally required to explain the emergence of outbreaks of AFM Our results provide evidence that changes in enterovirus phenotypes cause major changes in disease epidemiology

Increasing detections of vaccine derived poliovirus VDPV globally including in countries previously declared polio free is a public health emergency of international concern Individuals with primary immunodeficiency PID can excrete polioviruses for prolonged periods which could act as a source of cryptic transmission of viruses with potential to cause neurological disease Here we report on the detection of immunodeficiency associated VDPVs iVDPV from two asymptomatic male PID children in the UK in 2019 The first child cleared poliovirus with increased doses of intravenous immunoglobulin the second child following haematopoetic stem cell transplantation We perform genetic and phenotypic characterisation of the infecting strains demonstrating intra host evolution and a neurovirulent phenotype in transgenic mice Our findings highlight a pressing need to strengthen polio surveillance Systematic collection of stool from asymptomatic PID patients who are at high risk for poliovirus excretion could improve the ability to detect and contain iVDPVs

Population level surveillance systems have demonstrated reduced transmission of non SARS CoV 2 respiratory viruses during the COVID 19 pandemic In this study we examined whether this reduction translated to reduced hospital admissions and emergency department ED visits associated with influenza respiratory syncytial virus RSV human metapneumovirus human parainfluenza virus adenovirus rhinovirus enterovirus and common cold coronavirus in Ontario

Human animal pathogenic transmissions threaten both human and animal health and the processes catalyzing zoonotic spillover and spillback are complex Prior field studies offer partial insight into these processes but overlook animal ecologies and human perceptions and practices facilitating human animal contact Conducted in Cameroon and a European zoo this integrative study elucidates these processes incorporating metagenomic historical anthropological and great ape ecological analyses and real time evaluation of human great ape contact types and frequencies We find more enteric eukaryotic virome sharing between Cameroonian humans and great apes than in the zoo virome convergence between Cameroonian humans and gorillas and adenovirus and enterovirus taxa as most frequently shared between Cameroonian humans and great apes Together with physical contact from hunting meat handling and fecal exposure overlapping human cultivation and gorilla pillaging in forest gardens help explain these findings Our multidisciplinary study identifies environmental co use as a complementary mechanism for viral sharing

In May 2016 the Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI coordinated the cessation of all use of type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine OPV2 except for emergency outbreak response Since then paralytic polio cases caused by type 2 vaccine derived polioviruses now exceed 3 000 cases reported by 39 countries In 2022 as of April 25 2023 20 countries reported detection of cases and nine other countries reported environmental surveillance detection but no reported cases Recent development of a genetically modified novel type 2 OPV nOPV2 may help curb the generation of neurovirulent vaccine derived strains its use since 2021 under Emergency Use Listing is limited to outbreak response activities Prior modeling studies showed that the expected trajectory for global type 2 viruses does not appear headed toward eradication even with the best possible properties of nOPV2 assuming current outbreak response performance Continued persistence of type 2 poliovirus transmission exposes the world to the risks of potentially high consequence events such as the importation of virus into high transmission areas of India or Bangladesh Building on prior polio endgame modeling and assuming current national and GPEI outbreak response performance we show no probability of successfully eradicating type 2 polioviruses in the near term regardless of vaccine choice We also demonstrate the possible worst case scenarios could result in rapid expansion of paralytic cases and preclude the goal of permanently ending all cases of poliomyelitis in the foreseeable future Avoiding such catastrophic scenarios will depend on the development of strategies that raise population immunity to type 2 polioviruses

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 is one of the causative agents of hand foot mouth disease which can be associated with neurocomplications of the central nervous system A limited understanding of the virus s biology and pathogenesis has led to the unavailability of effective anti viral treatments The EV A71 RNA genome carries type I internal ribosomal entry site IRES at 5 UTR that plays an essential role in the viral genomic translation However the detailed mechanism of IRES mediated translation has not been elucidated In this study sequence analysis revealed that the domains IV V and VI of EV A71 IRES contained the structurally conserved regions The selected region was transcribed in vitro and labeled with biotin to use as an antigen for selecting the single chain variable fragment scFv antibody from the naïve phage display library The so obtained scFv namely scFv 16 3 binds specifically to EV A71 IRES The molecular docking showed that the interaction between scFv 16 3 and EV A71 IRES was mediated by the preferences of amino acid residues including serine tyrosine glycine lysine and arginine on the antigen binding sites contacted the nucleotides on the IRES domains IV and V The so produced scFv has the potential to develop as a structural biology tool to study the biology of the EV A71 RNA genome

This study determined the global genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of enterovirus B83 EV B83 and proposed future disease surveillance directions Blood samples were collected from a patient with viral myocarditis and viral isolation was performed The complete genome sequence of the viral isolate was obtained using Sanger sequencing A dataset of 15 sequences from three continents that had sufficient time signals for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was set up and the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of global EV B83 were analyzed using bioinformatics methods including evolutionary dynamics recombination event analysis and phylogeographic analysis Here we report the complete genome sequence of an EV B83 strain S17 YN CHN 2004 isolated from a patient with acute viral myocarditis in Yunnan Province China All 15 EV B83 strains clustered together in a phylogenetic tree confirming the classification of these isolates as a single EV type and the predicted time for the most recent common ancestor appeared in 1998 Recombinant signals were detected in the 5 untranslated region and 2A 3D coding regions of the S17 genome The phylogeographic analysis revealed multiple intercontinental transmission routes of EV B83 This study indicates that EV B83 is globally distributed Our findings add to the publicly available EV B83 genomic sequence data and deepen our understanding of EV B83 epidemiology

Respiratory viruses may interfere with each other and affect the epidemic trend of the virus However the understanding of the interactions between respiratory viruses at the population level is still very limited We here conducted a prospective laboratory based etiological study by enrolling 14 426 patients suffered from acute respiratory infection ARI in Beijing China during 2005 to 2015 All 18 respiratory viruses were simultaneously tested for each nasal and throat swabs collected from enrolled patients using molecular tests The virus correlations were quantitatively evaluated and the respiratory viruses could be divided into two panels according to the positive and negative correlations One included influenza viruses IFVs A B and respiratory syncytial virus RSV while the other included human parainfluenza viruses HPIVs 1 3 2 4 adenovirus Adv human metapneumovirus hMPV and enterovirus including rhinovirus named picoRNA α and β human coronaviruses HCoVs The viruses were positive correlated in each panel while negative correlated between panels After adjusting the confounding factors by vector autoregressive model positive interaction between IFV A and RSV and negative interaction between IFV A and picoRNA are still be observed The asynchronous interference of IFV A significantly delayed the peak of β human coronaviruses epidemic The binary property of the respiratory virus interactions provides new insights into the viral epidemic dynamics in human population facilitating the development of infectious disease control and prevention strategies

Enterovirus A71 EVA71 causes widespread disease in young children with occasional fatal consequences In common with other picornaviruses both empty capsids ECs and infectious virions are produced during the viral lifecycle While initially antigenically indistinguishable from virions ECs readily convert to an expanded conformation at moderate temperatures In the closely related poliovirus these conformational changes result in loss of antigenic sites required to elicit protective immune responses Whether this is true for EVA71 remains to be determined and is the subject of this investigation We previously reported the selection of a thermally resistant EVA71 genogroup B2 population using successive rounds of heating and passage The mutations found in the structural protein coding region of the selected population conferred increased thermal stability to both virions and naturally produced ECs Here we introduced these mutations into a recombinant expression system to produce stabilized virus like particles VLPs in

In 2022 a case of paralysis was reported in an unvaccinated adult in Rockland County RC New York Genetically linked detections of vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 VDPV2 were reported in multiple New York counties England Israel and Canada The aims of this qualitative study were to i review immediate public health responses in New York to assess the challenges in addressing gaps in vaccination coverage ii inform a longer term strategy to improving vaccination coverage in under vaccinated communities and iii collect data to support comparative evaluations of transnational poliovirus outbreaks Twenty three semi structured interviews were conducted with public health professionals healthcare professionals and community partners Results indicate that i addressing suboptimal vaccination coverage in RC remains a significant challenge after recent disease outbreaks ii the poliovirus outbreak was not unexpected and effort should be invested to engage mothers the key decision makers on childhood vaccination iii healthcare providers especially paediatricians received technical support during the outbreak and may require resources and guidance to effectively contribute to longer term vaccine engagement strategies vi data systems strengthening is required to help track under vaccinated children Public health departments should prioritize long term investments in appropriate communication strategies countering misinformation and promoting the importance of the routine immunization schedule

Acute flaccid paralysis AFP associated with enterovirus D68 EV D68 infection has attracted much attention since an outbreak in the USA in 2014 Notably EV D68 was detected in a child with AFP for the first time in China in 2018 In a multicentre study from May 2017 to December 2019 we monitored EV D68 infections in hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infection ALRTI in China Out of 3 071 samples collected from patients with ALRTI ten were positive for EV D68 All patients presented with mild diseases with no neurological symptoms or signs Phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 gene showed that all EV D68 sequences obtained in this study belonged to subclade B3 and were close to sequences of EV D68 strains obtained from patients with AFP in the USA Four EV D68 strains were isolated and their complete genome sequences were determined These sequences did not show any evidence of recombination events To assess their neurotropism the isolates were used to infect the neuronal like cell line SH SY5Y and resulted in a cytopathic effect We further analysed the structure and sites that may be associated with neurovirulence including the stem loop structure in the untranslated region 3 UTR and identified amino acid substitutions M291T V341A T860N D927N S1108G and R2005K in the coding region and specific nucleotides 127T 262C and 339T in the 5 UTR In conclusion EV D68 infection was detected in a small number of children with ALRTI in China from 2017 to 2019 Disease symptoms in these children were relatively mild with no neurological complications and all EV D68 sequences belonged to subclade B3

In 2013 a case of immunodeficiency vaccine derived poliovirus iVDPV was identified in Jiangxi Province China In this study we purified 14 type 3 original viral isolates from this case and characterized the molecular evolution of these iVDPVs for 298 days Genetic variants were found in most of the original viral isolates with complex genetic and evolutionary relationships among the variants A phylogenetic tree constructed based on the P1 region showed that these iVDPVs were classified into lineage A and B The dominant lineage B represents a major trend in virus evolution The nucleotide substitution rate at the third codon position 3CP estimated by the BEAST program was 1 76 10

The genomes of positive strand RNA viruses serve as a template for both protein translation and genome replication In enteroviruses a cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5 end of the genome functions as a switch to transition from viral translation to replication by interacting with host poly C binding protein 2 PCBP2 and the viral 3CDpro protein We determined the structures of cloverleaf RNA from coxsackievirus and poliovirus Cloverleaf RNA folds into an H type four way junction and is stabilized by a unique adenosine cytidine uridine A C U base triple involving the conserved pyrimidine mismatch region The two PCBP2 binding sites are spatially proximal and are located on the opposite end from the 3CDpro binding site on cloverleaf We determined that the A C U base triple restricts the flexibility of the cloverleaf stem loops resulting in partial occlusion of the PCBP2 binding site and elimination of the A C U base triple increases the binding affinity of PCBP2 to the cloverleaf RNA Based on the cloverleaf structures and biophysical assays we propose a new mechanistic model by which enteroviruses use the cloverleaf structure as a molecular switch to transition from viral protein translation to genome replication

Rhinovirus RV infections can progress from the upper URT to lower LRT respiratory tract in immunocompromised individuals causing high rates of fatal pneumonia Little is known about how RV evolves within hosts during infection

Encephalitis and meningitis are notable global public health concerns especially among infants or children Metagenomic next generation sequencing mNGS has greatly advanced our understanding of the viruses responsible for these diseases However the detection rate of the aetiology remains low We conducted RNA sequencing and virome analysis on cerebrospinal fluid CSF and serum samples commonly used in the clinical diagnosis to detect viral pathogens In total 226 paired CSF and serum samples from 113 children with encephalitis and meningitis were enrolled The results showed that the diversity of viruses was higher in CSF with a total of 12 viral taxa detected including one case each of herpesvirus coronavirus and enterovirus and six cases of adenovirus related to human diseases In contrast the

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is a nonpolio enterovirus associated with severe respiratory illness and acute flaccid myelitis AFM a polio like illness causing paralysis in children AFM outbreaks have been associated with increased circulation and genetic diversity of EV D68 since 2014 although the virus was discovered in the 1960s The mechanisms by which EV D68 targets the central nervous system are unknown Since enteroviruses are human pathogens that do not routinely infect other animal species establishment of a human model of the central nervous system is essential for understanding pathogenesis Here we describe two human spinal cord organoid hSCO based models for EV D68 infection derived from induced pluripotent stem cell iPSC lines One hSCO model consists primarily of spinal motor neurons while the another model comprises multiple neuronal cell lineages including motor neurons interneurons and glial cells These hSCOs can be productively infected with contemporary strains but not a historic strain of EV D68 and produce extracellular virus for at least 2 weeks without appreciable cytopathic effect By comparison infection with hSCO with another enterovirus echovirus 11 causes significant structural destruction and apoptosis Together these findings suggest that EV D68 infection is not the sole mediator of neuronal cell death in the spinal cord in those with AFM and that secondary injury from the immune response likely contributes to pathogenesis IMPORTANCE AFM is a rare condition that causes significant morbidity in affected children often contributing to life long sequelae It is unknown how EV D68 causes paralysis in children and effective therapeutic and preventative strategies are not available Mice are not native hosts for EV D68 and thus existing mouse models use immunosuppressed or neonatal mice mouse adapted viruses or intracranial inoculations To complement existing models we report two hSCO models for EV D68 infection These three dimensional multicellular models comprised human cells and include multiple neural lineages including motor neurons interneurons and glial cells These new hSCO models for EV D68 infection will contribute to understanding how EV D68 damages the human spinal cord which could lead to new therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for this virus

Acute respiratory infections are a constant public health problem causing childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide Reported cases of major respiratory infections decreased in 2020 after restrictive measures were adopted to contain the COVID 19 pandemic but there is little data on the impact after these measures were relaxed in the subsequent years This study conducted molecular analysis to identify rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus influenza A virus and adenovirus in SARS CoV 2 negative samples taken from symptomatic pediatric patients during 2021 and 2022 to ascertain the impact of pandemic response measures within the broader epidemiological scenario The positivity rates found were 28 3 and 50 8 in 2021 and 2022 respectively representing a significant increase 1 8 times in the circulation of non SARS CoV 2 viruses after the reduction of non pharmacological measures to contain the COVID 19 pandemic Within the positive samples rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were most frequent 44 4 and 18 in 2021 44 5 and 22 5 in 2022 whereas influenza A and adenovirus were found in lower frequency 12 5 and 5 5 in 2021 13 4 and 4 9 in 2022 respectively Because these different respiratory virus diseases produce similar symptoms diagnosis based on clinical condition alone can be inaccurate and more reliable testing is required to select the best therapeutic approach for each case The loosening of restrictive measures to contain the COVID 19 pandemic led to higher numbers of other respiratory infections in pediatric patients Ongoing surveillance and differential diagnosis of respiratory viruses are required to better understand their seasonal patterns after the COVID 19 pandemic to guide prevention and control strategies

Timely detection of outbreaks is needed for poliovirus eradication but gold standard detection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo takes 30 days median Direct molecular detection and nanopore sequencing DDNS of poliovirus in stool samples is a promising fast method Here we report prospective testing of stool samples from suspected polio cases and their contacts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 10 August 2021 and 4 February 2022 DDNS detected polioviruses in 62 2 339 2 7 of samples while gold standard combination of cell culture quantitative PCR and Sanger sequencing detected polioviruses in 51 2 339 2 2 of the same samples DDNS provided case confirmation in 7 days median in routine surveillance conditions DDNS enabled confirmation of three serotype 2 circulating vaccine derived poliovirus outbreaks 23 days mean earlier range 6 30 days than the gold standard method The mean sequence similarity between sequences obtained by the two methods was 99 98 Our data confirm the feasibility of implementing DDNS in a national poliovirus laboratory

Enterovirus B EVB is a common species of enterovirus mainly consisting of Echovirus Echo and Coxsackievirus B CVB The population is generally susceptible to EVB especially among children Since the 21st century EVB has been widely prevalent worldwide and can cause serious diseases such as viral meningitis myocarditis and neonatal sepsis By using cryo electron microscopy the three dimensional 3D structures of EVB and their uncoating receptors FcRn and CAR have been determined laying the foundation for the study of viral pathogenesis and therapeutic antibodies A limited number of epitopes bound to neutralizing antibodies have also been determined It is unclear whether additional epitopes are present or whether epitope mutations play a key role in molecular evolutionary history and epidemics as in influenza and SARS CoV 2 In the current study the conformational epitopes of six representative EVB serotypes E6 E11 E30 CVB1 CVB3 and CVB5 were systematically predicted by bioinformatics based epitope prediction algorithm We found that their epitopes were distributed into three clusters where the VP1 BC loop C terminus and VP2 EF loop were the main regions of EVB epitopes Among them the VP1 BC loop and VP2 EF loop may be the key epitope regions that determined the use of the uncoating receptors Further molecular evolution analysis based on the VP1 and genome sequences showed that the VP1 C terminus and VP2 EF loop as well as a potential breathing epitope VP1 N terminus were common mutation hotspot regions suggesting that the emergence of evolutionary clades was driven by epitope mutations Finally footprints showed mutations were located on or near epitopes while mutations on the receptor binding sites were rare This suggested that EVB promotes viral epidemics by breaking the immune barrier through epitope mutations but the mutations avoided the receptor binding sites The bioinformatics study of EVB epitopes may provide important information for the monitoring and early warning of EVB epidemics and developing therapeutic antibodies

Extracellular vesicles EVs including exosomes and microvesicles MVs are released by most cell types into the extracellular space and represent the pathophysiological condition of their source cells Recent studies demonstrate that EVs derived from infected cells and tumors contribute to disease pathogenesis However very few studies have rigorously characterized exosomes and microvesicles in infectious diseases In this study we focused on subpopulations of EVs during the human enterovirus infection and explored the distinct traits and functions of EVs We construct an effective immunomagnetic method to isolate exosomes and MVs from enterovirus infected cells excluding virion The morphology and sizes of exosomes and MVs have no significant alteration after enterovirus infection Meanwhile our study observed that the enterovirus infection could induce exosome secretion but not MVs In vivo study showed that there was differential biodistribution between exosomes and MVs Using deep RNA sequencing we found that the cargo information in MVs rather than in exosomes could accurately reflect pathological condition of original cells Our study demonstrated that it should be considered to use MVs as clinical diagnostics during in enterovirus infection because their composition is reflective of pathological changes

Global eradication of poliovirus remains elusive and it is critical to develop next generation vaccines and antivirals In support of this goal we map the epitope of human monoclonal antibody 9H2 which is able to neutralize the three serotypes of poliovirus Using cryo EM we solve the near atomic structures of 9H2 fragments Fab bound to capsids of poliovirus serotypes 1 2 and 3 The Fab virus complexes show that Fab interacts with the same binding mode for each serotype and at the same angle of interaction relative to the capsid surface For each of the Fab virus complexes we find that the binding site overlaps with the poliovirus receptor PVR binding site and maps across and into a depression in the capsid called the canyon No conformational changes to the capsid are induced by Fab binding for any complex Competition binding experiments between 9H2 and PVR reveal that 9H2 impedes receptor binding Thus 9H2 outcompetes the receptor to neutralize poliovirus The ability to neutralize all three serotypes coupled with the critical importance of the conserved receptor binding site make 9H2 an attractive antiviral candidate for future development

Evidence is emerging on the roles of long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs as regulatory factors in a variety of viral infection processes but the mechanisms underlying their functions in coxsackievirus group B type3 CVB3 induced acute viral myocarditis have not been explicitly delineated We previously demonstrated that CVB3 infection decreases miRNA 21 expression however lncRNAs that regulate the miRNA 21 dependent CVB3 disease process have yet to be identified To evaluate lncRNAs upstream of miRNA 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs in CVB3 infected mouse hearts were identified by microarray analysis and lncRNA miRNA 21 interactions were predicted bioinformatically MEG3 was identified as a candidate miRNA 21 interacting lncRNA upregulated in CVB3 infected mouse hearts MEG3 expression was verified to be upregulated in HeLa cells 48 h post CVB3 infection and to act as a competitive endogenous RNA of miRNA 21 MEG3 knockdown resulted in the upregulation of miRNA 21 which inhibited CVB3 replication by attenuating P38 MAPK signaling in vitro and in vivo Knockdown of MEG3 expression before CVB3 infection inhibited viral replication in mouse hearts and alleviated cardiac injury which improved survival Furthermore the knockdown of CREB5 which was predicted bioinformatically to function upstream of MEG3 was demonstrated to decrease MEG3 expression and CVB3 viral replication This study identifies the function of the lncRNA MEG3 miRNA 21 P38 MAPK axis in the process of CVB3 replication for which CREB5 could serve as an upstream modulator

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 causes cyclical outbreaks of respiratory disease and acute flaccid myelitis EV D68 is primarily transmitted through the respiratory route but the duration of shedding in the respiratory tract is unknown We prospectively enrolled 9 hospitalized children with EV D68 respiratory infection and 16 household contacts to determine EV D68 RNA shedding dynamics in the upper respiratory tract through serial midturbinate specimen collections and daily symptom diaries Five 31 3 household contacts including 3 adults were EV D68 positive The median duration of EV D68 RNA shedding in the upper respiratory tract was 12 range 7 15 days from symptom onset The most common symptoms were nasal congestion 100 cough 92 9 difficulty breathing 78 6 and wheezing 57 1 The median illness duration was 20 range 11 24 days Understanding the duration of RNA shedding can inform the expected rate and timing of EV D68 detection in associated acute flaccid myelitis cases and help guide public health measures

Wastewater surveillance WWS was developed in the early 1960s for the detection of poliovirus PV circulation in the population It has been used to monitor several pathogens including non polio enteroviruses NPEVs which are increasingly recognised as causes of morbidity in children However when applying WWS to a new pathogen it is important to consider the purpose of such a study as well as the suitability of the chosen methodology With this purpose the European Non Polio Enterovirus Network ENPEN organised an expert webinar to discuss its history methods and applications its evolution from a culture based method to molecular detection and future implementation of next generation sequencing NGS The first simulation experiments with PV calculated that a 400 mL sewage sample is sufficient for the detection of viral particles if 1 10 000 people excrete poliovirus in a population of 700 000 people If the method is applied correctly several NPEV types are detected Despite culture based methods remaining the gold standard for WWS direct methods followed by molecular based and sequence based assays have been developed not only for enterovirus but for several pathogens Along with case based sentinel and or syndromic surveillance WWS for NPEV and other pathogens represents an inexpensive flexible anonymised reliable population based tool for monitoring outbreaks and the re emergence of these virus types strains within the general population

Human non polio enteroviruses NPEVs are the etiological agents involved in most cases of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD herpangina and aseptic meningitis Information on the epidemiology profiles of NPEV in the Ural Federal District and Western Siberia is very limited with no published data available The aim of this study is to describe NPEV incidence in the Ural Federal District and Western Siberia among patients with different forms of non polio enterovirus infections NPEVIs during 2022 stratified by age and clinical manifestations A total of 265 samples that tested positive for NPEV using a polymerase chain reaction PCR were genotyped by semi nested PCR for the VP1 gene The results showed that 21 genotypes were identified among patients in this study CVA6 was the most common genotype for HFMD CVA6 along with CVA10 accounted for the majority of herpangina cases while CVA9 was implicated in most meningitis cases Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that nearly all of the CVA6 strains identified in this study displayed a close genetic relationship to strains identified in other cities in Russia and strains from China NPEV surveillance allows for monitoring the circulation of clinically relevant genotypes resulting in continuous data about NPEV epidemiology This is important for improving case prevention diagnosis and guiding clinical management

Ribonucleic acid RNA viruses pose heavy burdens on public health systems Synthetic biology holds great potential for artificially controlling their replication a strategy that could be used to attenuate infectious viruses but is still in the exploratory stage Herein we used the genetic code expansion technique to convert Enterovirus 71 EV71 a prototypical RNA virus into a controllable EV71 strain carrying the unnatural amino acid UAA Nε 2 azidoethyloxycarbonyl L lysine NAEK which we termed an EV71 NAEK virus After NAEK supplementation EV71 NAEK could recapitulate an authentic NAEK time and dose dependent infection in vitro which could serve as a novel method to manipulate virulent viruses in conventional laboratories We further validated the prophylactic effect of EV71 NAEK in two mouse models In susceptible parent mice vaccination with EV71 NAEK elicited a strong immune response and protected their neonatal offspring from lethal challenges similar to that of commercial vaccines Meanwhile in transgenic mice harboring a PylRS tRNACUAPyl pair substantial elements of genetic code expansion technology EV71 NAEK evoked an adjustable neutralizing antibody response in a strictly external NAEK dose dependent manner These findings suggested that EV71 NAEK could be the basis of a feasible immunization program for populations with different levels of immunity Moreover we expanded the strategy to generate controllable coxsackieviruses for conceptual verification In combination these results could underlie a competent strategy for attenuating viruses and priming the immune system via artificial control which might be a promising direction for the development of amenable vaccine candidates and be broadly applied to other RNA viruses

Enteroviruses primarily affect young children with a varying severity of disease Recent outbreaks of severe respiratory and neurological disease due to EV D68 and EV A71 as well as atypical hand foot and mouth disease due to CVA6 have brought to light the potency of enteroviruses to emerge as severe human pathogens Enterovirus D111 EV D111 is an enteric pathogen initially detected in Central Africa in human and wildlife samples and was recently detected in environmental samples The natural history and epidemiology of EV D111 are poorly studied Here the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to EV D111 was estimated in human and wildlife samples from five countries We report high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies measured against EV D111 in human populations range 55 83 a proxy for previous infection which indicates active virus circulation in absence of detection in clinical cases and a high number of undiagnosed infections Notably seroprevalence in samples from the UK varied by age and was higher in children and older adults 1 5 and 60 years old but lower in ages 11 60 EV D111 seroprevalence in apes and Old World monkeys was 50 33 66 which also suggests prior exposure and supports existing knowledge of enterovirus circulation in wild and captive apes and Old World monkeys Generally reported cases of infection likely underestimate the prevalence of infection particularly when the knowledge of community transmission is limited Continued serologic surveillance and detection of EV D111 in clinical and environmental samples will allow for a more robust assessment of EV D111 epidemiology

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD caused by a group of enteroviruses is a global public health problem In recent years coxsackievirus A6 CVA6 has emerged as an important HFMD agent Previous studies have shown that mutations of glycine 64 in RNA dependent RNA polymerase 3D polymerase which is central to viral replication cause phenotypic changes such as ribavirin resistance increased replication fidelity and virulence attenuation in poliovirus and enterovirus A71 In this study we constructed CVA6 mutants with G64R G64S and G64T substitutions by site directed mutagenesis in full length cDNA of an infectious CVA6 strain cloned in pcDNA3 1 Viral RNA was obtained by in vitro transcription and the rescued virus strains were propagated in RD cells Sequencing after six passages revealed that G64S and G64T mutations were stably inherited whereas G64R was genetically unstable and reversed to the wild type Comparison of the biological characteristics of the wild type and mutant CVA6 strains in an in vivo model one day old ICR mice revealed that the pathogenicity of CVA6 G64S and CVA6 G64T was significantly reduced compared to wild type CVA6 In vitro experiments indicated the mutant CVA6 G64S and CVA6 G64T strains had increased resistance to 0 8 mM ribavirin and a decreased replication rate in the presence of 0 8 mM guanidine hydrochloride Our results show that mutation of residue 64 reduces CVA6 susceptibility to ribavirin and increases CVA6 susceptibility to guanidine hydrochloride together with increased replication fidelity and attenuated viral pathogenicity thus laying a foundation for the development of safe and effective live attenuated CVA6 vaccine

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD caused by enterovirus A71 EV A71 infection currently lacks specific preventive and therapeutic interventions Here we demonstrated that Pien Tze Huang PZH could dose dependently inhibit EV A71 replication at the cellular level resulting in significant reductions in EV A71 virus protein 1 VP1 expression and viral yields in Vero and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells More importantly we confirmed that PZH could protect mice from EV A71 infection for the first time with Ribavirin serving as a positive control PZH treatment reduced EV A71 VP1 protein expression viral yields in infected muscles and improved muscle pathology Additionally we conducted a preliminary mechanism study using quantitative proteomics The results suggested that the suppression of the PI3K AKT mTOR and NF κB signaling pathways may contribute to the anti EV A71 activity of PZH These findings provide strong evidence supporting the potential therapeutic application of PZH for EV A71 infection management

Enterovirus infections induce infectious diseases in young children such as hand foot and mouth disease which is characterized by highly contagious rashes or blisters around the hands feet buttocks and mouth This predominantly arises from enterovirus A71 or coxsackievirus A16 infections and in severe cases they can lead to encephalitis paralysis pulmonary edema or even fatality representing a global health threat Due to the absence of effective therapeutic strategies for these infections various experimental animal models are being investigated for the development of vaccines During the early stages of research on enterovirus infections non human primate infections exhibited symptoms like those in humans leading to their utilization as model animals However due to economic and ethical considerations their current usage is limited While enterovirus infections do not readily occur in mice an infection model with mouse adapted strain in neonatal mice has been employed Cellular receptors have been identified in human cells and genetically modified mice expressing these receptors have been used Most recently the utilization of Mongolian gerbil model is actively being considered and should be pursued for further animal model development So herein we provide a summarized overview of the current portfolio of available enterovirus infection models emphasizing their respective advantages and limitations

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 primarily spreads through the respiratory tract and causes respiratory symptoms in children and acute flaccid myelitis AFM Type III interferons IFNs play a critical role in inhibiting viral growth in respiratory epithelial cells However the mechanism by which EV D68 induces type III IFN production is not yet fully understood In this study we show that EV D68 infection stimulates Calu 3 cells to secrete IFN λ The transfection of EV D68 viral RNA vRNA stimulated IFN λ via MDA5 Furthermore our findings provide evidence that EV D68 infection also induces MDA5 IRF3 IRF7 mediated IFN λ In addition we discovered that EV D68 infection downregulated MDA5 expression Knockdown of MDA5 increased EV D68 replication in Calu 3 cells Finally we demonstrated that the IFN λ1 and IFN λ2 3 proteins effectively inhibit EV D68 infection in respiratory epithelial cells In summary our study shows that EV D68 induces type III IFN production via the activated MDA5 IRF3 IRF7 pathway and that type III IFNs inhibit EV D68 replication in Calu 3 cells

Recent decades have witnessed the emergence and re emergence of numerous medically important viruses that cause central nervous system CNS infections in children e g Zika West Nile and enterovirus parechovirus Children with immature immune defenses and blood brain barrier are more vulnerable to viral CNS infections and meningitis than adults Viral invasion into the CNS causes meningitis encephalitis brain imaging abnormalities and long term neurodevelopmental sequelae Rapid and accurate detection of neurotropic viral infections is essential for diagnosing CNS diseases and setting up an appropriate patient management plan The addition of new molecular assays and next generation sequencing has broadened diagnostic capabilities for identifying infectious meningitis encephalitis However the expansion of test menu has led to new challenges in selecting appropriate tests and making accurate interpretation of test results There are unmet gaps in development of rapid sensitive and specific molecular assays for a growing list of emerging and re emerging neurotropic viruses Herein we will discuss the advances and challenges in the laboratory diagnosis of viral CNS infections in children This review not only sheds light on selection and interpretation of a suitable diagnostic test for emerging re emerging neurotropic viruses but also calls for more research on development and clinical utility study of novel molecular assays IMPACT Children with immature immune defenses and blood brain barrier especially neonates and infants are more vulnerable to viral central nervous system infections and meningitis than adults The addition of new molecular assays and next generation sequencing has broadened diagnostic capabilities for identifying infectious meningitis and encephalitis There are unmet gaps in the development of rapid sensitive and specific molecular assays for a growing list of emerging and re emerging neurotropic viruses

Following the successful control of poliovirus the re emergence of respiratory enterovirus D68 EV D68 a prominent non polio enterovirus has become a serious public health concern worldwide Host innate immune responses are the primary defense against EV D68 invasion however the mechanism underlying viral evasion of the antiviral activity of interferons IFN remains unclear In this study we found that EV D68 inhibited type I IFN signaling by cleaving signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 STAT1 a crucial factor in cellular responses to interferons and other cytokines We observed that the prototype and circulating EV D68 strains conserved their ability to induce STAT1 cleavage and attenuate IFN signal transduction Further investigation revealed that EV D68 3C protease cleaves STAT1 at the 131Q residue Interestingly not all enterovirus encoded 3C proteases exhibited this ability EV D68 and poliovirus 3C proteases efficiently induced STAT1 cleavage whereas 3C proteases from EV A71 coxsackievirus A16 and echoviruses did not STAT1 cleavage also abolished the nuclear translocation capacity of STAT1 in response to IFN stimulation to activate downstream signaling elements Overall these results suggest that STAT1 targeted by viral protease 3C is utilized by EV D68 to subvert the host s innate immune response IMPORTANCEEnterovirus D68 EV D68 has significantly transformed over the past decade evolving from a rare pathogen to a potential pandemic pathogen The interferon IFN signaling pathway is an important defense mechanism and therapeutic target for the host to resist viral invasion Previous studies have reported that the EV D68 virus blocks or weakens immune recognition and IFN production in host cells through diverse strategies however the mechanisms of EV D68 resistance to IFN signaling have not been fully elucidated Our study revealed that EV D68 relies on its own encoded protease 3C to directly cleave signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 STAT1 a pivotal transduction component in the IFN signaling pathway disrupting the IFN mediated antiviral response Previous studies on human enteroviruses have not documented direct cleavage of the STAT1 protein to evade cellular immune defenses However not all enteroviral 3C proteins can cleave STAT1 These findings highlight the diverse evolutionary strategies different human enteroviruses employ to evade host immunity

Cockroaches are considered mechanical transmitters of infectious diseases posing a threat to human health This study assessed the potential of cockroaches in food related environments to mechanically transmit intestinal pathogens Cockroaches captured with traps were placed together into a low temperature refrigerator at 80 for 2 h Standard taxonomic keys and Fluorescent quantitative PCR techniques were applied for species identification and digestive tract etiological examination A total of 360 cockroach traps were placed with a positive rate of 20 8 and 266 cockroaches were captured In general compared with other places and areas the degree of infestation of cockroaches was more serious in catering places and kitchens Blattella germanica were most found in catering places 40 2 followed by Periplaneta fuliginosa in schools 22 2 According to the life stage among the 128 cockroach samples 23 were positive for nymphs and 13 were positive for adults There were statistically significant differences in the intestinal pathogen detection rates between nymphs and adults P 0 05 A total of eight intestinal pathogens were detected and enterovirus infections were the main ones with sapovirus being the most detected in Blattella germanica or nymph Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli STEC was the most frequently isolated bacterium Blastocystis hominis had the highest isolation rate In contrast 12 diarrhoeal disease pathogens were isolated and the viruses and bacteria with the highest frequencies were norovirus and E coli respectively no parasites were found Blattella germanica and Periplaneta fuliginosa in food related environments can act as potential vectors for the spread of intestinal pathogens and may pose a significant threat to public health

More than 100 types of non polio enteroviruses NPEVs are ubiquitous in the human population and cause a variety of symptoms ranging from very mild to meningitis and acute flaccid paralysis AFP Much of the information regarding diverse pathogenic properties of NPEVs comes from the surveillance of poliovirus which also yields NPEV The analysis of 265 NPEV isolations from 10 433 AFP cases over 24 years of surveillance and more than 2500 NPEV findings in patients without severe neurological lesions suggests that types EV A71 E13 and E25 were significantly associated with AFP EV A71 was also significantly more common among AFP patients who had fever at the onset and residual paralysis compared to all AFP cases In addition a significant disparity was noticed between types that were common in humans CV A2 CVA9 EV A71 E9 and E30 or in sewage CVA7 E3 E7 E11 E12 and E19 Therefore there is significant evidence of non polio viruses being implicated in severe neurological lesions but further multicenter studies using uniform methodology are needed for a definitive conclusion

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is predominantly associated with mild respiratory infections but can also cause severe respiratory disease and extra respiratory complications including acute flaccid myelitis Systemic dissemination of EV D68 is crucial for the development of extra respiratory diseases but it is currently unclear how EV D68 spreads systemically viremia We hypothesize that immune cells contribute to the systemic dissemination of EV D68 as this is a mechanism commonly used by other enteroviruses Therefore we investigated the susceptibility and permissiveness of human primary immune cells for different EV D68 isolates In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells inoculated with EV D68 only B cells were susceptible but virus replication was limited However in B cell rich cultures such as Epstein Barr virus transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line BLCL and primary lentivirus transduced B cells which better represent lymphoid B cells were productively infected Subsequently we showed that dendritic cells DCs particularly immature DCs are susceptible and permissive for EV D68 infection and that they can spread EV D68 to autologous BLCL Altogether our findings suggest that immune cells especially B cells and DCs could play an important role in the pathogenesis of EV D68 infection Infection of these cells may contribute to systemic dissemination of EV D68 which is an essential step toward the development of extra respiratory complications IMPORTANCEEnterovirus D68 EV D68 is an emerging respiratory virus that has caused outbreaks worldwide since 2014 EV D68 infects primarily respiratory epithelial cells resulting in mild respiratory diseases However EV D68 infection is also associated with extra respiratory complications including polio like paralysis It is unclear how EV D68 spreads systemically and infects other organs We hypothesized that immune cells could play a role in the extra respiratory spread of EV D68 We showed that EV D68 can infect and replicate in specific immune cells that is B cells and dendritic cells DCs and that virus could be transferred from DCs to B cells Our data reveal a potential role of immune cells in the pathogenesis of EV D68 infection Intervention strategies that prevent EV D68 infection of immune cells will therefore potentially prevent systemic spread of virus and thereby severe extra respiratory complications

Parechovirus infections usually affect neonates and young children manifestations vary from asymptomatic to life threatening We describe laboratory capacity in Europe for assessing parechovirus circulation seasonality and epidemiology We used retrospective anonymized data collected from parechovirus infection case patients identified in Europe during January 2015 December 2021 Of 21 laboratories from 18 countries that participated in the study 16 76 laboratories with parechovirus detection capacity reported 1 845 positive samples 12 16 75 with typing capability successfully identified 517 samples Parechovirus A3 was the most common type n 278 followed by A1 153 A6 50 A4 13 A5 22 and A14 1 Clinical data from 1 269 participants highlighted correlation of types A3 A4 and A5 with severe disease in neonates We observed a wide capacity in Europe to detect type and analyze parechovirus data To enhance surveillance and response for PeV outbreaks sharing typing protocols and data on parechovirus positive cases should be encouraged

Given the serious neurological complications and deaths associated with enterovirus 71 EV71 infection there is an urgent need to develop effective antivirals against this viral infection In this study we demonstrated that two Cathelicidin derived peptides LL 18 and FF 18 were more potent against EV71 infection than the parent peptide LL 37 which is the mature and processed form of Cathelicidin These peptides could directly bind to the EV71 virus particles but not to coxsackievirus indicative of their high specificity The binding of peptides with the virus surface occupied the viral canyon region in a way that could block virus receptor interactions and inhibit viral uncoating In addition these peptide analogues could also relieve the deleterious effect of EV71 infection in vivo Therefore Cathelicidin derived peptides might be excellent candidates for further development of antivirals to treat EV71 infection

In Iran which is at high risk of the Wild Poliovirus WPV and Vaccine Derived Poliovirus VDPV importation due to its neighborhood with two polio endemic countries Pakistan and Afghanistan Environmental Surveillance ES was established in November 2017 Sistan Balouchestan province was chosen for the ES due to its vicinity with Pakistan and Afghanistan Five sewage collection sites in 4 cities Zahedan Zabol Chabahar and Konarak were selected in the high risk areas Since the establishment of ES in November 2017 till the end of 2023 364 sewage specimens were collected and analyzed The ES detected polioviruses which have the highest significance for polio eradication program that is Wild Poliovirus type 1 WPV1 and Poliovirus type 2 PV2 In April and May 2019 three of 364 0 8 sewage specimens from Konarak were positive for imported WPV1 According to phylogenetic analysis they were highly related to WPV1 circulating in Karachi Sindh province in Pakistan PV2 was also detected in 5 7 21 364 of the sewage specimens most of which proved to be imported from the neighboring countries Of 21 isolated PV2s 7 were VDPV2 of which 5 proved to be imported from the neighboring countries as there was VDPV2 circulating in Pakistan at the time of sampling and 2 were ambiguous VDPVs aVDPV with unknown source According to the findings of this study as long as WPV1 and VDPV2 outbreaks are detected in Iran s neighboring countries there is a definite need for continuation and expansion of the environmental surveillance

Human enteroviruses are the most common human pathogen with over 300 distinct genotypes Previous work with poliovirus has suggested that it is possible to generate antibody responses in humans and animals that can recognize members of multiple enterovirus species However cross protective immunity across multiple enteroviruses is not observed epidemiologically in humans Here we investigated whether immunization of mice or baboons with inactivated poliovirus or enterovirus virus like particles VLPs vaccines generates antibody responses that can recognize enterovirus D68 or A71 We found that mice only generated antibodies specific for the antigen they were immunized with and repeated immunization failed to generate cross reactive antibody responses as measured by both ELISA and neutralization assay Immunization of baboons with IPV failed to generate neutralizing antibody responses against enterovirus D68 or A71 These results suggest that a multivalent approach to enterovirus vaccination is necessary to protect against enterovirus disease in vulnerable populations

The globally reemerging respiratory pathogen enterovirus D68 EV D68 is implicated in outbreaks of severe respiratory illness and associated with acute flaccid myelitis However there remains a lack of effective treatments for EV D68 infection In this work we found that the host Toll like receptor 7 TLR7 proteins which function as powerful innate immune sensors were selectively elevated in expression in response to EV D68 infection Subsequently we investigated the impact of Vesatolimod GS 9620 a Toll like receptor 7 agonist on EV D68 replication Our findings revealed that EV D68 infection resulted in increased mRNA levels of TLR7 Treatment with Vesatolimod significantly inhibited EV D68 replication half maximal effective concentration EC

Major 5 terminally deleted 5 TD RNA forms of group B coxsackievirus CVB 5 TD has been associated with myocarditis in both mice and humans Although it is known that interferon β IFN β signaling is critical for an efficient innate immune response against CVB induced myocarditis the link between CVB 5 TD RNA forms and type I IFN signaling in cardiomyocytes remains to be explored In a mouse model of CVB3 28 induced myocarditis major early emerging forms of CVB 5 TD RNA have been characterized as replicative viral populations that impair IFN β production in the heart Synthetic CVB3 28 RNA forms mimicking each of these major 5 TD virus populations were transfected in mice and have been shown to modulate innate immune responses in the heart and to induce myocarditis in mice Remarkably transfection of synthetic viral RNA with deletions in the secondary structures of the 5 terminal CVB3 RNA domain I modifying stem loops b c or d were found to impair IFN β production in human cardiomyocytes In addition the activation of innate immune response by Poly I C was found to restore IFN β production and to reduce the burden of CVB 5 TD RNA forms in cardiac tissues thereby reducing the mortality rate of infected mice Overall our results indicate that major early emerging CVB3 populations deleted in the domain I of genomic RNA in the 5 noncoding region modulate the activation of the type I IFN pathway in cardiomyocytes and induce myocarditis in mice These findings shed new light on the role of replicative CVB 5 TD RNA forms as key pathophysiological factors in CVB induced human myocarditis

The increasing emergence and re emergence of RNA virus outbreaks underlines the urgent need to develop effective antivirals RNA interference RNAi is a sequence specific gene silencing mechanism that is triggered by small interfering RNAs siRNAs or short hairpin RNAs shRNAs which exhibits significant promise for antiviral therapy AGO2 dependent shRNA agshRNA generates a single stranded guide RNA and presents significant advantages over traditional siRNA and shRNA In this study we applied a logistic regression algorithm to a previously published chemically siRNA efficacy dataset and built a machine learning based model with high predictive power Using this model we designed siRNA sequences targeting diverse RNA viruses including human enterovirus A71 EV71 Zika virus ZIKV dengue virus 2 DENV2 mouse hepatitis virus MHV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 and transformed them into agshRNAs We validated the performance of our agshRNA design by evaluating antiviral efficacies of agshRNAs in cells infected with different viruses Using the agshRNA targeting EV71 as an example we showed that the anti EV71 effect of agshRNA was more potent compared with the corresponding siRNA and shRNA Moreover the antiviral effect of agshRNA is dependent on AGO2 processed guide RNA which can load into the RNA induced silencing complex RISC We also confirmed the antiviral effect of agshRNA in vivo Together this work develops a novel antiviral strategy that combines machine learning based algorithm with agshRNA design to custom design antiviral agshRNAs with high efficiency

SETD3 is an essential host factor for the replication of a variety of enteroviruses that specifically interacts with viral protease 2A However the interaction between SETD3 and the 2A protease has not been fully characterized Here we use X ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy to determine the structures of SETD3 complexed with the 2A protease of EV71 to 3 5 Å and 3 1 Å resolution respectively We find that the 2A protease occupies the V shaped central cleft of SETD3 through two discrete sites The relative positions of the two proteins vary in the crystal and cryo EM structures showing dynamic binding A biolayer interferometry assay shows that the EV71 2A protease outcompetes actin for SETD3 binding We identify key 2A residues involved in SETD3 binding and demonstrate that 2A s ability to bind SETD3 correlates with EV71 production in cells Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in EV71 infected and 2A expressing cells indicate that 2A interferes with the SETD3 actin complex and the disruption of this complex reduces enterovirus replication Together these results reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the interplay between SETD3 actin and viral 2A during virus replication

A cumulative effect of enterovirus and gluten intake on the risk of celiac disease autoimmunity in infants highlights the significance of viral exposure in early life on the health of children However pathogenic viruses may be transmitted to the offspring in an earlier period raising the possibility that women whose vaginas are inhabited by such viruses may have had their babies infected as early as the time of delivery A high resolution intergenerational virome atlas was obtained by metagenomic sequencing and virome analysis on 486 samples from six body sites of 99 mother neonate pairs We found that neonates had less diverse oral and enteric viruses than mothers Vaginally delivered newborns seconds after birth had a more similar oral virome and more viruses of vaginal origin than cesarean section C section newborns 56 9 vs 5 8 Such viruses include both

Acute encephalitis syndrome AES is a major public health concern in India as the aetiology remains unknown in the majority of cases with the current testing algorithm We aimed to study the incidence of Japanese encephalitis JE and determine the aetiology of non JE AES cases to develop an evidence based testing algorithm Cerebrospinal fluid CSF samples were tested for Japanese encephalitis virus by ELISA and polymerase chain reaction PCR Multiplex real time PCR was done for Dengue Chikungunya West Nile Zika Enterovirus Epstein Barr Virus Herpes Simplex Virus Adenovirus Cytomegalovirus Herpesvirus 6 Parechovirus Parvovirus B19 Varicella Zoster Virus Scrub typhus Rickettsia species Leptospira Salmonella species Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis Plasmodium species and by ELISA for Mumps and Measles virus Of the 3173 CSF samples 461 14 5 were positive for JE Of the 334 non JE AES cases 66 2 viz Scrub typhus 25 7 Mumps 19 5 Measles 4 2 Parvovirus B19 3 9 Plasmodium 2 7 HSV 1 and 2 2 4 EBV and Streptococcus pneumoniae 2 1 each Salmonella and HHV 6 1 2 each were predominant Hence an improved surveillance system and our suggested expanded testing algorithm can improve the diagnosis of potentially treatable infectious agents of AES in India

The kinetics of type I interferon IFN induction versus the virus replication compete and the result of the competition determines the outcome of the infection Chaperone proteins that involved in promoting the activation kinetics of PRRs rapidly trigger antiviral innate immunity We have previously shown that prior to the interaction with MAVS to induce type I IFN 14 3 3η facilitates the oligomerization and intracellular redistribution of activated MDA5 Here we report that the cleavage of 14 3 3η upon MDA5 activation and we identified Caspase 3 activated by MDA5 dependent signaling was essential to produce sub 14 3 3η lacking the C terminal helix αI and tail The cleaved form of 14 3 3η sub 14 3 3η could strongly interact with MDA5 but could not support MDA5 dependent type I IFN induction indicating the opposite functions between the full length 14 3 3η and sub 14 3 3η During human coronavirus or enterovirus infections the accumulation of sub 14 3 3η was observed along with the activation of Caspase 3 suggesting that RNA viruses may antagonize 14 3 3η by promoting the formation of sub 14 3 3η to impair antiviral innate immunity In conclusion sub 14 3 3η which could not promote MDA5 activation may serve as a negative feedback to return to homeostasis to prevent excessive type I IFN production and unnecessary inflammation

Like all biological populations viral populations exist as networks of genotypes connected through mutation Mapping the topology of these networks and quantifying population dynamics across them is crucial to understanding how populations adapt to changes in their selective environment The influence of mutational networks is especially profound in viral populations that rapidly explore their mutational neighborhoods via high mutation rates Using a single cell sequencing method scRNA seq enabled acquisition of mRNA and consensus haplotypes linking individual genotypes and host transcriptomes SEARCHLIGHT we captured and assembled viral haplotypes from hundreds of individual infected cells revealing the complexity of viral population structures We obtained these genotypes in parallel with host cell transcriptome information enabling us to link host cell transcriptional phenotypes to the genetic structures underlying virus adaptation Our examination of these structures reveals the common evolutionary dynamics of enterovirus populations and illustrates how viral populations reach through mutational tunnels to span evolutionary landscapes and maintain connection with multiple adaptive genotypes simultaneously

The open source drug library namely MMV Pandemic Response Box contains 153 antiviral agents a chemically and pharmacologically diverse mixture of early stage emerging anti infective scaffolds and mature compounds currently undergoing clinical development Hence the Pandemic Response Box might contain compounds that bind and interfere with target molecules or cellular pathways that are conserved or shared among the closely related viruses with enterovirus A71 EV A71 This study aimed to screen antiviral agents included in the Pandemic Response Box for repurposing to anti EV A71 activity and investigate the inhibitory effects of the compounds on viral replication The compounds cytotoxicity and ability to rescue infected cells were determined by cell survival using an SRB assay The hit compounds were verified for anti EV A71 activity by virus reduction assays for viral RNA copy numbers viral protein synthesis and mature particle production using qRT PCR Western blot analysis and CCID

In this study we investigated the features of co infection with SARS CoV 2 and the enterovirus vaccine strain LEV8 of coxsackievirus A7 or enterovirus A71 for Vero E6 cells and Syrian hamsters The investigation of co infection with SARS CoV 2 and LEV 8 or EV A71 in the cell model showed that a competitive inhibitory effect for these viruses was especially significant against SARS CoV 2 Pre infection with enteroviruses in the animals caused more than a 100 fold decrease in the levels of SARS CoV 2 virus replication in the respiratory tract and more rapid clearance of infectious SARS CoV 2 from the lower respiratory tract Co infection with SARS CoV 2 and LEV 8 or EV A71 also reduced the severity of clinical manifestations of the SARS CoV 2 infection in the animals Additionally the histological data illustrated that co infection with strain LEV8 of coxsackievirus A7 decreased the level of pathological changes induced by SARS CoV 2 in the lungs Research into the chemokine cytokine profile demonstrated that the studied enteroviruses efficiently triggered this part of the antiviral immune response which is associated with the significant inhibition of SARS CoV 2 infection These results demonstrate that there is significant viral interference between the studied strain LEV 8 of coxsackievirus A7 or enterovirus A71 and SARS CoV 2 in vitro and in vivo

Non pharmaceutical interventions NPI have been proven successful in a population based approach to protect from SARS CoV 2 transmission during the COVID 19 pandemic As a consequential effect a reduction in the spread of all respiratory viruses has been observed but the primary factors behind this phenomenon have yet to be identified We conducted a subgroup analysis of participants from the ELISA study a prospective longitudinal cohort study on SARS CoV 2 transmission at four timepoints from November 2020 September 2022 The aim was to provide a detailed overview of the circulation of respiratory viruses over 2 years and to identify potential personal risk factors of virus distribution All participants were screened using qPCR for respiratory viral infections from nasopharyngeal swabs and answered a questionnaire regarding behavioral factors Several categories of risk factors for the transmission of respiratory viruses were evaluated using a scoring system In total 1 124 participants were included in the study showing high adherence to governmental introduced NPI The overall number of respiratory virus infections was low 0 4 9 of participants with adenovirus 1 7 rhino enterovirus 3 2 and SARS CoV 2 1 2 being the most abundant We detected an inverse correlation between the number and intensity of NPI and the number of detected respiratory viruses More precisely the attendance of social events and household size was associated with rhino enterovirus infection while social contacts were associated with being positive for any virus NPI introduced during the COVID 19 pandemic reduced the occurrence of seasonal respiratory viruses in our study showing different risk factors for enhanced transmission between viruses

The Hand Foot and Mouth Disease HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 infection is a global public health emergency Severe HFMD poses a significant threat to the life and well being of children Numerous studies have indicated that the occurrence of severe HFMD is associated with cytokine storm However the precise molecular mechanism underlying cytokine storm development remains elusive and there are currently no safe and effective treatments available for severe HFMD in children

Diarrheal diseases constitute a significant public health problem in terms of mortality and morbidity In Honduras and around the world RVs have consistently emerged as the single most important etiologic agent in acute childhood diarrhea However other viruses such as NoVs and HAstVs have also been shown to be responsible for viral gastroenteritis Unfortunately the country has limited information concerning the etiologic role of these viral agents in acute gastroenteritis This study investigated the frequency genotypes and epidemiological characteristics of RV A NoVs and HAstVs among children under 5 years old in Distrito Central Honduras

In Sicily Italy respiratory syncytial virus RSV rhinovirus HRV and influenza virus triggered epidemics among children resulting in an increase in acute respiratory tract infections ARTIs Our objective was to capture the epidemiology of respiratory infections in children determining which pathogens were associated with respiratory infections following the lockdown and whether there were changes in the epidemiological landscape during the post SARS CoV 2 pandemic era

RNA viruses have notoriously high mutation rates due to error prone replication by their RNA polymerase However natural selection concentrates variability in a few key viral proteins To test whether this stems from different mutation tolerance profiles among viral proteins we measured the effect of 40 000 non synonymous mutations across the full proteome of coxsackievirus B3 as well as 97 of all possible codon deletions in the nonstructural proteins We find significant variation in mutational tolerance within and between individual viral proteins which correlated with both general and protein specific structural and functional attributes Furthermore mutational fitness effects remained stable across cell lines suggesting selection pressures are mostly conserved across environments In addition to providing a rich dataset for understanding virus biology and evolution our results illustrate that incorporation of mutational tolerance data into druggable pocket discovery can aid in selecting targets with high barriers to drug resistance

Enterovirus A71 EV A71 causes Hand Foot and Mouth Disease and has been clinically associated with neurological complications However there is a lack of relevant models to elucidate the neuropathology of EV A71 and its mechanism as the current models mainly utilize animal models or immortalized cell lines In this study we established a human motor neuron model for EV A71 infection Single cell transcriptomics of a mixed neuronal population reveal higher viral RNA load in motor neurons suggesting higher infectivity and replication of EV A71 in motor neurons The elevated RNA load in motor neurons correlates with the downregulation of ferritin encoding genes Subsequent analysis confirms that neurons infected with EV A71 undergo ferroptosis as evidenced by increased levels of labile Fe

Enteroviruses contain conserved RNA structures at the extreme 5 end of their genomes that recruit essential proteins 3CD and PCBP2 to promote genome replication However the high resolution structures and mechanisms of these replication linked RNAs REPLRs are limited Here we determined the crystal structures of the coxsackievirus B3 and rhinoviruses B14 and C15 REPLRs at 1 54 2 2 and 2 54 Å resolution revealing a highly conserved H type four way junction fold with co axially stacked sA sD and sB sC helices that are stabilized by a long range A C U base triple Such conserved features observed in the crystal structures also allowed us to predict the models of several other enteroviral REPLRs using homology modeling which generated models almost identical to the experimentally determined structures Moreover our structure guided binding studies with recombinantly purified full length human PCBP2 showed that two previously proposed binding sites the sB loop and 3 spacer reside proximally and bind a single PCBP2 Additionally the DNA oligos complementary to the 3 spacer the high affinity PCBP2 binding site abrogated its interactions with enteroviral REPLRs suggesting the critical roles of this single stranded region in recruiting PCBP2 for enteroviral genome replication and illuminating the promising prospects of developing therapeutics against enteroviral infections targeting this replication platform

Japan experienced a large outbreak of wild poliovirus in the 1960s The government made an exceptional decision to import oral polio vaccines OPVs from the Soviet Union and Canada while bypassing the usual approval process for medical products Mass vaccination and subsequent routine immunization successfully contained the wild poliovirus the last case in Japan was reported in 1980 Domestic OPV had been used to sustain Japan s polio free state In 2012 the world s first inactivated polio vaccine developed from the Sabin vaccine replaced OPVs Domestic vaccines combined with Sabin derived inactivated polio vaccine are currently used in Japan When the World Health Assembly announced the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988 the Japanese government made a commitment to support endemic countries The Japan International Cooperation Agency supported the establishment of microbiological laboratories surveillance distribution of polio vaccines and capacity building Vaccine derived poliovirus emerged as a new international risk in the early 2000s Vaccine derived poliovirus was also detected in several Asian countries and required an outbreak response with additional vaccinations and strengthened surveillance Genetically stable novel oral polio vaccine type 2 became available for use in outbreak responses and was used in Indonesia Japan maintains its commitment to work toward the eradication of the poliovirus

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 is an emerging agent for which data on the susceptible adult population is scarce We performed a 6 year analysis of respiratory samples from influenza like illness ILI admitted during 2014 2020 in 4 10 hospitals in the Valencia Region Spain EV D68 was identified in 68 3 1 among 2210 Enterovirus EV Rhinovirus HRV positive samples Phylogeny of 59 VP1 sequences showed isolates from 2014 clustering in B2 6 12 B1 5 12 and A2 D1 1 12 subclades those from 2015 n 1 and 2016 n 1 in B3 and A2 D1 respectively and isolates from 2018 in A2 D3 42 45 and B3 3 45 B1 and B2 viruses were mainly detected in children 80 and 67 respectively B3 were equally distributed between children and adults whereas A2 D1 and A2 D3 were observed only in adults B3 viruses showed up to 16 amino acid changes at predicted antigenic sites In conclusion two EV D68 epidemics linked to ILI hospitalized cases occurred in the Valencia Region in 2014 and 2018 with three fatal outcomes and one ICU admission A2 D3 strains from 2018 were associated with severe respiratory infection in adults Because of the significant impact of non polio enteroviruses in ILI and the potential neurotropism year round surveillance in respiratory samples should be pursued

Enteroviruses EVs are ubiquitous viruses that circulate worldwide causing sporadic or epidemic infections typically during the summer and fall They cause a broad spectrum of illnesses ranging from an unspecified febrile clinical presentation to a severe illness EVs are recognized to be the most frequent etiological agents of aseptic meningitis in children However as the infection is usually mild and self limiting it remains underestimated and the epidemiology of EVs is poorly understood To date no vaccine or effective therapy for all types of enteroviruses is available and EVs constitute a public health concern Here we investigated the molecular epidemiology of EV strains circulating in the Lazio region over a 10 year time span 2012 2023 by using a sequence typing approach and phylogenetic analysis The epidemiological trend of EV infection has undergone changes during the SARS CoV 2 pandemic 2020 2021 which resulted in a modification in terms of the number of diagnosed cases and seasonality From 2022 the circulation of EVs showed a behavior typical of the pre pandemic period although changes in predominantly circulating strains have been noted Both epidemic and sporadic circulation events have been characterized in the Lazio region Further analyses are needed to better characterize any strain with higher potential pathogenic power and to identify possible recombinant strains

There is evidence suggesting that Notch1 signaling pathway contributes to the development of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD however the role of Notch1 gene polymorphisms in the severity of coxsackievirus A6 CVA6 related HFMD remains unclear This study aimed to investigate the correlation between Notch1 gene polymorphisms and the severity of CVA6 related HFMD

Echovirus 30 E30 a member of the species B Enterovirus family is a primary pathogen responsible for aseptic meningitis and encephalitis E30 is associated with severe nervous system diseases and is a primary cause of child illness disability and even mortality However the mechanisms underlying E30 induced brain injury remain poorly understood In this study we used a neonatal mouse model of E30 to investigate the possible mechanisms of brain injury E30 infection triggered the activation of microglia in the mouse brain and efficiently replicated within HMC3 cells Subsequent transcriptomic analysis revealed inflammatory activation of microglia in response to E30 infection We also detected a significant upregulation of polo like kinase 1 PLK1 and found that its inhibition could limit E30 infection in a sucking mouse model Collectively E30 infection led to brain injury in a neonatal mouse model which may be related to excessive inflammatory responses Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between E30 infection and neurological damage providing crucial insights that could guide the development of interventions and strategies to address the severe clinical manifestations associated with this pathogen

Coronary heart disease CHD is a common cardiovascular disease that is associated with altered gut microbiota Enteroviruses an essential component of the gut microbiome may play an important role in disease progression However the relationship between enteroviruses and CHD remains unclear The development of high throughput sequencing technologies has facilitated research on the interconnections between viruses and disease related metabolites

Pathogens of the enterovirus genus including poliovirus and coxsackieviruses typically circulate in the summer months suggesting a possible positive association between warmer weather and transmission Here we evaluate the environmental and demographic drivers of enterovirus transmission as well as the implications of climate change for future enterovirus circulation We leverage pre vaccination era data on polio in the US as well as data on two enterovirus A serotypes in China and Japan that are known to cause hand foot and mouth disease Using mechanistic modeling and statistical approaches we find that enterovirus transmission appears positively correlated with temperature although demographic factors particularly the timing of school semesters remain important We use temperature projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 CMIP6 to simulate future outbreaks under late 21st century climate change for Chinese provinces We find that outbreak size increases with climate change on average though results differ across climate models depending on the degree of wintertime warming In the worst case scenario we project peak outbreaks in some locations could increase by up to 40

Advanced genomic technologies such as whole exome or whole genome sequencing have improved diagnoses and disease outcomes for individuals with genetic diseases Yet variants of unknown significance VUS require rigorous validation to establish disease causality or modification or to exclude them from further analysis Here we describe a young individual of Polynesian ancestry who in the first 13 mo of life presented with SARS CoV 2 pneumonia severe enterovirus meningitis and adenovirus gastroenteritis and severe adverse reaction to MMR vaccination Genomic analysis identified a previously reported pathogenic homozygous variant in IFNAR1 c 1156G T p Glu386 LOF which is common in Western Polynesia Moreover a new and putatively deleterious canonical splice site variant in DOCK8 was also found in homozygosity c 3234 2T C This DOCK8 variant is common in Polynesians and other under represented ancestries in large genomic databases Despite in silico bioinformatic predictions extensive in vitro and ex vivo analysis revealed the DOCK8 variant likely be neutral Thus our study reports a novel case of IFNAR1 deficiency but also highlights the importance of functional validation of VUS including those predicted to be deleterious and the pressing need to expand our knowledge of the genomic architecture and landscape of under represented populations and ancestries

Enterovirus D68 EV D68 a respiratory RNA virus in the family Picornaviridae is implicated as a potential etiological agent for acute flaccid myelitis in preteen adolescents The absence of a specific therapeutic intervention necessitates the development of an effective animal model for EV D68 The AG129 mouse strain characterized by the double knockout of IFN α β and IFN γ receptors on the 129 genetic background has been proposed as a suitable model for EV D68 The goals of this study were to assess the effect of a nonmouse adapted EV D68 strain US MO 14 18947 NR 49129 in AG129 IFN α β and IFN γ receptors null A129 IFN α β receptor null G129 IFN γ receptor null and the 129 background strain 129S2 SvPasCrl when infected intraperitoneally at 10 d of age Both AG129 and A129 strains demonstrated similar clinical signs paralysis paresis lethargy dyspnea characterized by prominent abdominal respiration and morbidity requiring euthanasia induced by EV D68 While G129 and 129S2 strains also exhibited susceptibility to EV D68 the severity of clinical signs was less than in AG129 and A129 strains and many survived to the experimental endpoint Histopathological and immunohistochemical data confirmed EV D68 tropism for the skeletal muscle and spinal cord and suggest that the dyspnea observed in infected mice could be attributed in part to lesions in the diaphragmatic skeletal muscles These findings contribute valuable insights into the pathogenesis of EV D68 infection in this mouse model and provide investigators with key information on virus dose and mouse strain selection when using this mouse model to evaluate candidate EV D68 therapeutics

Enterovirus 71 EV 71 has strong neurotropism and it is the main pathogen causing severe hand foot and mouth disease HFMD In clinical observations significant differences were observed in the severity and prognosis of HFMD among children who were also infected with EV 71 Genetic differences among individuals could be one of the important causes of differences in susceptibility to EV 71 induced HFMD As P selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 PSGL 1 is an important receptor of EV 71 the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in PSGL 1 and the susceptibility to severe HFMD following EV 71 infection is worth studying Given the role of PSGL 1 in immunity the correlations between PSGL 1 SNPs and the immune status after EV 71 infection are also worth studying Meanwhile PSGL 1 variable number of tandem repeats VNTR represents a research hotspot in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases but PSGL 1 VNTR polymorphism has not been investigated in HFMD caused by EV 71 infection In this study specific gene fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and PSGL 1 VNTR sequences were genotyped using an automatic nucleic acid analyzer The correlations of PSGL 1 VNTR polymorphism with the susceptibility to EV 71 associated severe HFMD and the post infection immune status were analyzed The PSGL 1 VNTR A allele was identified as a susceptible SNP for severe HFMD The risk of severe HFMD was higher for AA AB genotype carriers than for BB genotype carriers The counts of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were lower in AA AB genotype carries than in BB genotype carries In conclusion PSGL 1 VNTR polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility to EV 71 induced severe HFMD and the immune status after infection PSGL 1 VNTR might play a certain role in the pathogenesis of severe cases

Polioviruses PVs are positive strand RNA viruses responsible for poliomyelitis Many PVs have been isolated and phenotypically characterized in the 1940s 50s for the purpose of identifying attenuated strains that could be used as vaccine strains Among these historical PVs only few are genetically characterized We report here the sequencing of four PV strains stored for more than 60 years in a sealed box These PVs are cold variants that were selected by Albert Sabin based on their capacity to multiply at relatively low temperatures Inoculation of permissive cells at 25 C showed that two of the four historical virus stocks still contained infectious particles Both viruses reached titres that were higher at 25 C than at 37 C thus demonstrating that they were genuine cold variants We obtained sequences that span virtually all the genome for three out of the four strains a short sequence that partly covers the 5 untranslated region was recovered for the last one Unexpectedly the genome of one historical cold variant which derives from PV 3 Glenn displayed a very high nucleotide identity above 95 with that of a PV strain PV 3 strain WIV14 sampled in China in 2014 and then classified as a highly evolved vaccine derived PV Our analyses made this hypothesis very unlikely and strongly suggested that Glenn and WIV14 shared a very recent common ancestor with one another Some strains used to produce the inactivated polio vaccine were also very close to Glenn and WIV14 in the capsid encoding region but they had not been sequenced beyond the capsid We therefore sequenced one of these strains Saukett A which was available in our collection Saukett A and WIV14 featured an identity higher than 99 at the nucleotide level This work provides original data on cold variants that were produced and studied decades ago It also highlights that sequences of historical PV strains could be crucial to reliably characterize contemporary PVs in case of release from a natural reservoir or from a facility which is of highest importance for the PV eradication program

Human enteroviruses are highly prevalent world wide Up to more than 100 subtypes of enteroviruses can cause several diseases including encephalitis meningitis myocarditis hand foot mouth disease conjunctivitis respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal diseases thus posing a great threat to human health This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of enterovirus in children in Hangzhou China before and after the COVID 19 outbreak Systematic monitoring of enterovirus infections was performed by collecting samples from the children admitted to the inpatient wards and outpatient departments in the Children s Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine between January 2019 and May 2023 A commercial real time RT PCR kit was utilized to detect enteroviruses Among the 34 152 samples collected 1162 samples accounting for 3 4 of the samples were tested positive for enteroviruses The annual positive rates of the enteroviruses were 5 46 1 15 4 43 1 62 and 1 96 in 2019 2020 2021 2022 and May 2023 respectively The positivity rate of the enteroviruses was highest among children aged 3 5 years and 5 7 years Moreover the monthly positivity rate of enterovirus infection ranged from 0 32 to 10 38 with a peak in June and July Serotypes especially EV71 and CA16 causing severe symptoms such as HFMD were decreasing while the proportion of unidentified serotypes was on the rise The incidence of enteroviruses in Hangzhou was higher in children aged 1 3 years and 7 18 years

Coxsackievirus group B CVB a member of the

Coxsackievirus A24 CV A24 is a human enterovirus that causes acute flaccid paralysis However a Coxsackievirus A24 variant CV A24v is the most common cause of eye infections The causes of these variable pathogenicity and tissue tropism remain unclear To elucidate the phylodynamics of CV A24 and CV A24v we analyzed a dataset of 66 strains using Bayesian phylodynamic approach along with detailed sequence variation and epistatic analyses Six CV A24 strains available in GenBank and 60 CV A24v strains including 11 Taiwanese strains were included in this study The results revealed striking differences between CV A24 and CV A24v exhibiting long terminal branches in the phylogenetic tree respectively CV A24v presented distinct ladder like clustering indicating immune escape mechanisms Notably 10 genetic recombination events in the 3D regions were identified Furthermore 11 missense mutation signatures were detected to differentiate CV A24 and CV A24v among these mutations the F810Y substitution may significantly affect the secondary structure of the GH loop of VP1 and subsequently affect the epitopes of the capsid proteins In conclusion this study provides critical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of CV A24 and CV A24v and highlights the differences in viral evolution and tissue tropism

In the post pandemic period an endemic circulation of respiratory viruses has been re established Respiratory viruses are co circulating with SARS CoV 2 We performed a retrospective analysis of co infections in primary care patients with medically attended acute respiratory infections MAARI who consulted from week 40 2022 to week 39 2023 and were tested for a panel of respiratory viruses Out of 2099 samples tested 1260 60 0 were positive for one virus In 340 samples co infection was detected two viruses in 281 13 4 three viruses in 51 2 4 and four viruses in eight 0 4 samples Respiratory viruses co infected the patients with MAARI at very different rates The lowest rates of co infections were confirmed for influenza B 13 8 and influenza A 22 9 and the highest for human bocaviruses 84 0 and human parechoviruses 82 1 Co infections were detected in 28 2 of SARS CoV 2 positive samples SARS CoV 2 has never been co infected with influenza B virus enterovirus or adenovirus although the latter was found as a co infecting virus with all other respiratory viruses tested The rate of co infections decreased significantly with increasing age

Ubiquitin modification of viral proteins to degrade or regulate their function is one of the strategies of the host to resist viral infection Here we report that ubiquitin protein ligase E3C UBE3C an E3 ubiquitin ligase displayed inhibitory effects on EV A71 replication UBE3C knockdown resulted in increased viral protein levels and virus titers whereas overexpression of UBE3C reduced EV A71 replication To explore the mechanism by which UBE3C affected EV A71 infection we found that the C terminal of UBE3C bound to 2C protein and facilitated K33 K48 linked ubiquitination degradation of 2C K268 Moreover UBE3C lost its ability to degrade 2C K268R and had a diminished inhibitory impact against the replication of recombinant EV A71 FY 2C K268R In addition UBE3C also promoted ubiquitination degradation of the 2C protein of CVB3 and CVA16 and inhibited viral replication Thus our findings reveal a novel mechanism that UBE3C acts as an enterovirus host restriction factor including EV A71 by targeting the 2C protein

Hand foot and mouth disease HFMD is a prevalent acute infectious disease caused by enteroviruses presenting substantial public health challenges in Shanghai especially among children The dynamic nature of HFMD s etiology necessitates an ongoing evaluation of its epidemiological and virological trends to inform effective control strategies This study aims to investigate the epidemiological patterns and viral evolution of HFMD in Fengxian District Shanghai China with a focus on shifts in predominant viral strains over a 14 year period We conducted a retrospective analysis of HFMD cases reported to the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System in Fengxian District from January 1 2009 to December 31 2022 Epidemiological trends strain prevalence and demographic impacts were assessed A total of 27 272 HFMD cases were documented during the study period with incidence showing pronounced seasonal fluctuations peaking in spring and summer and a lesser peak in autumn The disease incidence demonstrated significant positive correlations with several meteorological variables daily average temperature r 0 30 P 0 05 relative humidity r 0 20 P 0 05 wind speed r 0 17 P 0 05 and precipitation r 0 17 P 0 05 Geographically Nanqiao Town Fengcheng Town and Xidu Subdistrict reported the highest incidence rates The demographic analysis revealed a male to female ratio of 1 60 1 predominantly affecting children aged 1 3 years Prior to 2017 Enterovirus 71 EV71 and Coxsackievirus A16 CoxA16 were the primary detected strains post 2017 Coxsackievirus A6 CoxA6 emerged as the dominant strain Statistical analysis confirmed significant year to year variations in virus detection rates with decreasing trends for EV71 and other enteroviruses and an increasing trend for CoxA6 The findings indicate a distinct seasonal incidence of HFMD in Fengxian District This study underscores the need for targeted public health education enhanced surveillance and proactive measures in childcare facilities to mitigate disease spread during peak seasons Moreover the evolving viral landscape warrants accelerated efforts in vaccine development against new strains to reduce HFMD incidence

Enterovirus 71 EV71 belongs to the family of

Innate immune cells have been acknowledged as trainable in recent years While intestinal tuft cells are recognized for their crucial roles in the host defense against intestinal pathogens there remains uncertainty regarding their trainability Enterovirus 71 EV71 a prevalent enterovirus that primarily infects children but rarely infects adults At present there is a significant expansion of intestinal tuft cells in the EV71 infected mouse model which is associated with EV71 induced interleukin 25 IL 25 production Further we found that IL 25 pre treatment at 2 weeks old mouse enabled tuft cells to acquire immune memory This was evidenced by the rapid expansion and stronger response of IL 25 trained tuft cells in response to EV71 infection at 6 weeks old surpassing the reactivity of naïve tuft cells in mice without IL 25 trained progress Interestingly IL 25 trained intestinal tuft cells exhibit anti enteroviral effect via producing a higher level of IL 25 Mechanically IL 25 treatment upregulates spermidine spermine acetyl transferase enzyme SAT1 expression mediates intracellular polyamine deficiency further inhibits enterovirus replication In summary tuft cells can be trained by IL 25 which supports faster and higher level IL 25 production in response to EV71 infection and further exhibits anti enteroviral effect via SAT1 mediated intracellular polyamine deficiency Given that IL 25 can be induced by multiple gut microbes during human growth and development including shifts in gut flora abundance which may partially explain the different susceptibility to enteroviral infections between adults and children

The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic caused by SARS CoV 2 continues to pose significant global health challenges The results demonstrated that GB 2 at 200 μg mL effectively increased the population of 293T ACE2 cells with low RBD binding for both SARS CoV 2 Omicron EG 5 1 and HV 1 variants by dual color flow cytometry indicating its ability to inhibit virus attachment Further investigation revealed that catechin at 25 and 50 μg mL did not significantly alter the ACE2 RBD interaction for the EG 5 1 variant In contrast theaflavin showed inhibitory effects at both 25 and 50 μg mL for EG 5 1 while only the higher concentration was effective for HV 1 Notably theaflavin 3 gallate exhibited a potent inhibition of ACE2 RBD binding for both variants at both concentrations tested Molecular docking studies provided insight into the binding mechanisms of theaflavin and theaflavin 3 gallate with the RBD of EG 5 1 and HV 1 variants Both compounds showed favorable docking scores with theaflavin 3 gallate demonstrating slightly lower scores 8 kcal mol compared to theaflavin 7 kcal mol for both variants These results suggest stable interactions between the compounds and key residues in the RBD potentially explaining their inhibitory effects on virus attachment In conclusion GB 2 theaflavin and theaflavin 3 gallate demonstrate significant potential as inhibitors of the ACE2 RBD interaction in Omicron variants highlighting their therapeutic promise against COVID 19 However these findings are primarily based on computational and in vitro studies necessitating further in vivo research and clinical trials to confirm their efficacy and safety in humans

Patients with Primary immunodeficiency PIDs may be infected by Polioviruses PVs especially when vaccinated with live Oral Polio Vaccine before diagnosis They may establish long term shedding of divergent strains and may act as reservoirs of PV transmission This study delved into the effect of the genetic evolution of complete PV genomes from MHC class II deficient patients on the excretion duration and clinical outcomes Stool samples from three PID patients underwent analysis for PV detection through inoculation on cell culture and real time PCR followed by VP1 partial sequencing and full genome sequencing using the Illumina technology Our findings revealed a low number of mutations for one patient who cleared the virus while two exhibited a high intra host diversity favoring the establishment of severe outcomes Neurovirulence reverse mutations were detected in two patients possibly leading to paralysis development Furthermore a recombination event between type 3 Vaccine Derived Poliovirus and Sabin like1 VDPV3 SL1 occurred in one patient Our findings have suggested an association between intra host diversity recombination prolonged excretion of the virus and emergence of highly pathogenic strains Further studies on intra host diversity are crucial for a better understanding of the virus evolution as well as for the success of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative

Some respiratory viruses such as Human Rhinovirus SARS CoV 2 and Enterovirus D 68 EV D68 share the feature of hijacking host lipids in order to generate specialised replication organelles ROs with unique lipid compositions to enable viral replication We have recently uncovered a novel non canonical function of the stimulator of interferon genes STING pathway as a critical factor in the formation of ROs in response to HRV infection The STING pathway is the main DNA virus sensing system of the innate immune system controlling the type I IFN machinery Although it is well characterised as part of the DNA sensor machinery the STING function in RNA viral infections is largely unexplored In the current study we investigated whether other RO forming RNA viruses such as EV D68 and SARS CoV 2 can also utilise STING for their replication Using genetic and pharmacological inhibition we demonstrate that STING is hijacked by these viruses and is utilised as part of the viral replication machinery STING also co localises with glycolytic enzymes needed to fuel the energy for replication The inhibition of STING leads to the modulation of glucose metabolism in EV D68 infected cells suggesting that it might also manipulate immunometabolism Therefore for RO generating RNA viruses STING seems to have non canonical functions in membrane lipid re modelling and the formation of replication vesicles as well as immunometabolism

To investigate the effect of Enterovirus A71 EV71 vaccination on the transmissibility of different enterovirus serotypes of hand foot and mouth disease HFMD in Zhejiang China

BackgroundIn 2023 a European alert was issued regarding an increase in severe enterovirus EV neonatal infections associated with echovirus 11 E11 new lineage 1 AimTo analyse E11 positive cases between 2019 and 2023 to investigate whether the new lineage 1 circulated in Spain causing severe neonatal infections MethodsEV positive samples from hospitalised cases are sent for typing to the National Reference Enterovirus Laboratory Available samples from 2022 23 were subjected to metagenomic next generation sequencing ResultsOf 1 288 samples genotyped 103 were E11 positive 98 patients 6 adults 33 neonates 89 children under 6 years male to female ratio 1 9 E11 detection rate was similar before and after detection of the new lineage 1 in Spain in June 2022 9 7 in 2019 vs 10 6 in 2023 The proportion of E11 infected ICU admitted neonates in 2019 2022 2 7 vs 2022 2023 5 12 did not significantly differ p 0 65 In severe neonatal infections 4 7 E11 strains were not linked to the new lineage 1 The three novel E11 recombinant genomes were associated with severe n 2 and non severe n 1 cases from 2022 2023 and clustered outside the new lineage 1 Coinfecting pathogenic viruses were present in four of 10 E11 positive samples ConclusionThe emergence of the new lineage 1 is not linked with an increase in incidence or severity of neonatal E11 infections in Spain The detection of two novel E11 recombinants associated with severe disease warrants enhancing genomic and clinical surveillance

Echovirus type 18 E18 is a member of the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae In this study we investigated the characteristics of E18 infections in hospitalized adults with meningoencephalitis that occurred during an unusual epidemic in south western Hungary in mid 2023 Five 6 1 out of 82 cerebrospinal fluid specimens that were tested were positive for an enterovirus four of which were E18 OR372160 and PP861087 PP861090 Headache 100 fever 75 retrobulbar pain 50 nausea 50 joint limb pain 50 exanthema photophobia and vomiting were the most common symptoms Sequence analysis showed that these viruses were related to unpublished emerging E18 strains from France 2022 2023 and China 2019 2020 Further study is necessary to monitor the circulation of epidemic pandemic E18 variants over time

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 in March 2020 led to the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions NPIs to curb its spread Studies have shown that adult asthma exacerbations and viral infections decreased during NPI use However few studies have shown the effects of NPIs on pediatric asthma exacerbations and infections during and after the pandemic

Neural stem cells have intact innate immune responses that protect them from virus infection and cell death Yet viruses can antagonize such responses to establish neuropathogenesis Using a forebrain organoid model system at two developmental time points we identified that neural stem cells in particular radial glia are basally primed to respond to virus infection by upregulating several antiviral interferon stimulated genes Infection of these organoids with a neuropathogenic Enterovirus D68 strain demonstrated the ability of this virus to impede immune activation by blocking interferon responses Together our data highlight immune gene signatures present in different types of neural stem cells and differential viral capacity to block neural specific immune induction
